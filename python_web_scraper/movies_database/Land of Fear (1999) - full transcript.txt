I finally found a boringbut comfortable job.I worked in a billiard hall.CAIRO, 1968.- Why are you late?- Student protest on the road.The new chief inspector is here.- Does he want something?- He's just playing.Hello, Omar.Hello.Congratulations. I hearyou've been promoted.Are you here to play?No, I work here.Didn't you know? I thoughtyou guys know everything.Why don't you practice law?Would the guild have me?The bribe accusation was serious.They probably wouldn't.By the way.If we meet again, addressme as 'Mister Omar'.We're not colleagues anymore.I bore this dull and austere life,as I bore jail, waiting for an eventthat I felt was coming.I observed the world I leftlike one who never lived in it.I had lost the abilityto express my feelings.I had no friends orfamily. I kept to myself.I was content with superficial,meaningless relationships.Here's the paper.Get me some tea."Major general Mohammad Maamoun""died yesterday of asudden heart attack".One question had hauntedme since I started this new life:Had I made the right decision?- Why am I here?- Just following orders.Listen, Yahya.This is a top secret meeting.The minister chose not to be hereto ensure there would be no leaks.We've investigated you thoroughly,including your academicdays, and your family history.We studied your personality carefully.We analyzed your behaviorunder duress, and your moral fiber.For example, the way yourecuperated your stolen gun.Also, the way you refused to be bribed.Not only did you refuse thebribe. You reported it immediately.There are other examples.There was a report against me.The report clinched our decision.Others would not havedared to go against the minister.We want to recruit an officerfor a highly sensitive mission.The mission is to implant an agentin the hierarchy of the drug trade.The goal of the missionis to infiltrate their organizationand reveal its connection to otherssuch as the weapons trade andthe smuggling of ancient artifacts.You will also expose corrupt cops.Your mission will lastyour entire lifetime.The police will not protect you.You will be treated asa drug lord, a criminal.You're to rise in their organizationand reach its deepest secrets.You will then feed us thatinformation.Two people will be in theknow: The minister of interior,and the chief of intelligence.They will pass thesecret to their successors.This will never bementioned in any record.You will receive a certificate signedby both to be placed in a bank safe.Your mission code name is 'Landof Fear'. It will end with your death.If you are ever found guilty of crimes,or even given the capitalpunishment, the statement will save you.You will first transfer togeneral intelligence.You will pretend you are acorrupt anti-drugs policeman.You will gradually get in trouble.If you are offered a bribe,accept it. You might go to jail.This will be your gatewayto the crime world.You will be tainted with crime.You won't be simplypretending you're corrupt.You will truly live your corruption.You will be truly a drugdealer, truly a criminal.Deep in the recesses of your mind,you shall remain a police officer.You will betray, and kill,and steal, and poison,and the police will hound you.This is a hard mission.Your life will be arduous,with two simple joys:The thrill of adventure, andthe pursuit of a noble goal.Your life will be reorganized.You will assume anew corrupt personality.We will send you to the Landof Fear with a new code name:Adam.All done, wiseguy.Call me that again,and I'll kill you.I was asked to leave mylife for a more turbulent one.A life of doubt, and fear, and death.Keep out of it.Calm down.Continue your game.Get them some drinks.Get out of my way.Enough.Don't just hit randomly.Use your head.You're wasted in this place.Call me, I have a better job for you.THE NIGHTLIFE.May God protect you from the evil eye.Tell Yahya to come in.Come in, sir.Any news?The hall is full, andso are the pockets.We're going to make a killing.Give me a smoke, andtell them to hurry up.Here you go.Excuse me.The basha wants to greet Rabab.She is not accepting guests.Come on. This guy is rolling in dough.Sorry, not a chance.Tell her.- What is it?- Nothing, sir.She's still getting dressed.Basyouni was a big drug dealer.I hated him the moment I sawhim. He had a bad reputation.He brutally removedobstacles in his way.- A car is following us.- Two cars.They're catching up.Lock the doors. Drive away if you can.Stay here.Good evening.Did you think I'd let that pass?Don't you know who I am?Who doesn't know you, sir?Get out of my way.- No.- Says who?Her bodyguard.Very good.Move it.We appreciate that you didnot name anyone to the police.The basha sends thisgift with his regards.Stay seated.There's no need for this.He can rest assured.He may shoot my other leg if he'd like.Meaning?I mean nothing. It's all in the past.Let's forget about it.Excuse me.10 thousands pounds, you fool.Why didn't you tell the police?What good would that do?Drop Yahya off.- Ever been married?- No.I have. I was fifteen.I ran away a year later. I toldmy mother to get me a divorce.He wouldn't divorce me.And then?I started dancing. Imade a lot of money.I paid him 500 pounds. He divorcedme. Now marriage scares me.You know I bought the MoulinRouge 3 months ago. It's almost ready.Wanna run it?Let me finish.If you want to, we'll marry.I'll own it, and you'll run it for me.You want to marry mebecause you need a manager?I need a man I can count on.You're a man, and a good one.We're together anyway.I love you, you stupid man.I did not love Rabab,but I really wanted to marry her.That is when I realized thatthe old Yahya did not love her,but that wiseguy Yahyawanted to marry her.Madame, wake up.It's 3 PM.Good morning. Breakfast is ready.Wake up already you lazy bum.Come on, get up.What's this?What happened?When the chief of intelligence died, Idid not know who inherited my secret,but when the May 15 purgeeliminated the old guard,I knew who now held my secret.I was afraid I'd fall through thecracks during those turbulent times.The man you are mockingused to be very influential.He'd spend 100 pounds a day.Who said otherwise? I'mjust saying he's an old man now.Beware of speaking ill of people.My aunt used to say: Speak ill ofpeople, and they'll speak ill of you.Who would dare do that, you dog?Don't be upset, boss.- But they do talk.- What do they say?I can't say.Speak, fool.They say Yahya is a kept man.Shut up.It's OK. What else do they say?Am I not the manager?They know you are,and yet they talk.- What else?- They say you are a punk.They say you're being cheated on.You mean to say I'm...I know you aren't. Butpeople like to gossip.People gossip aboutme too. They say I'm a fruit.Aren't you a fruit?"Fruit" means a gay man, right?I'm not a man to start with.What to do?We must change people's perceptions.How?You find another job.- Quit the cabaret?- No.Change your image.They say you always getbeaten, and you never hit back,like that time with Basyouni.That's the word on the street.You should wear aveil. It's the style now.What will you do?Me? I don't know.If you stopped dancing, and hechanged his ways, I'd still be gay.I can't change that.I'll find another dancer, another band,and another woman willhit me with her sandal.You son of a dog.Lola was right.To enter the underworld,I needed a reputation.I did not have that reputation yet.The door was still shut to me.Yes, dear?I've noticed something.- What is it?- The smell of smoke.- It's not a big deal.- Yes, it is.I was not born yesterday.You'll selling drugs. This has to stop.Come in.I'm leaving.This is the last time I mention this.Something to drink?- What is it?- I...Can we speak outside?Of course.You know my son Mohammad.He's my eldest, my right hand man.He's my only heir. God damn them.He'll get out of it, I'm sure.The lawyers say it does not lookgood. The judge is a problem.Should you change lawyers?No, they're the best there is.I wish I could do something.- You can.- Me?The trial is in a month.It will be his lastchance. He must escape.What can I do?You're wiseguy Yahia.You used to know them well.I can't do it myself.Security will be tight.It's his last chance. Eitherhe makes it, or he dies.You know their ways, don't you?Yes, but...It's been a while.Ask around. You have connections.Come up with a plan.- How much will you pay?- A hundred thousand. Just do it.Your son had money on himwhen he got caught, right?Yes, a million pounds.- Didn't he offer it to the officer?- He did.- What happened?- It didn't work.The officer turned it down.Crazy fool.The officer refused a million pounds,and you're offering me 100,000?Did I get that right?Can you do it?Maybe.How much?- 2 million.- Are you insane?Not at all. Anyway...I can't accept any less.I don't have it.- Pay me in merchandise.- Merchandise?How will you sell it?You're going to help me sell it.You want in on the game, don't you?Today I took my first steptowards the drug trade.The goal is to rescue AlManzalawi during his trial.I must ensure a certain corrupt officeris on the scene on that day.I'll stage the escape ofanother inmate under his watch.He'll catch him, and hisname will be in the headlines.Make sure he is assignedto Manzalawi for the trial.Yours truly, Adam.OFFICER ABED EL TAWWAB REWARDED.Nice to see you.- That man was tedious.- Yes.What's this?Good evening.- What is it?- You got the message?The goods?I mean the message.2 million, like you asked.The message is: 'if youmess around, I'll get to you.'I can't leave it in the house.No worries. We'll keep it for you.Call me tomorrow.I told you I won't tolerate this.You'll leave the houseand take it with you.You can come back if you give it up.If you don't, I'll divorce you.Take a right.Did you hear me?Hello Abou Khalil.Here are the keys.The plane ticket, and the passport.- Count your money.- No need.Bring him over.Open up.Go inside.Turn around.Don't peek.Not even me?Especially not you. You're naughty.Hurry up, turn around.Fine, turn around.Take her.Go with them.In order to become a drug lord,I had to be feared.I had to commit aspectacular act of violence.I had to do it with my own hands.However, I must confessthat I drew personalpleasure from killing Basyouni.This is how wiseguy Yahya becamewiseguy Yahya, the drug lord.CAIRO, 1981.Go to the cars.Where to?Mister Ibrahim?Let's go downtown.Downtown it is.Welcome.Welcome, mister Rajab.Thank you.You've heard of thesemen, but don't know them.Mister Manzelawi, incontrol of El Sawahiliyah.The lake is his personal property.He knows every fish,its name, age, and address.Mister Houdhoud,emperor of Al Batiniyah.A son of the land. Alwaysready to do a favor to a friend.Mister wieseguy Yahya.Cunning and wise.On top of that, he used to be a cop.Honest and clean.I am Ibrahim El Hout,at your service.Where shall we go?The Nile Hilton.If you were to move 1million pounds worth of pot,you'd need a truck.There is a goodchance the police finds it.Right?Moreover, what is the percentage ofpot that is intercepted at the border?Many problems.Consider The consumer, the pot smoker.When the price goes up,he reduces his consumption.If it is hard to procure,he stops buying it.What profit do you make? 100%?One pound for each invested pound?I'm not even mentioningthe problems of storage...What's the point, buddy?I mean mister Rajab.I mean to say that pot is not worth it.What shall we sellthen? Home appliances?We want a 500% profit rate.A substance that is easy to move.It could be hidden inside a tire.Once you try it, you're hooked.You always come back for more.Powder. I am talking about powder.This is the future.This bag will bring you 100,000 pounds,and it can fit in a suitcaseinstead of a van.What does a million get us?5 million.One million of powdernets you 5 million.We'd be criminals.What do you think we are?There are limits. It's not the same.True. The profit won'tbe the same either.Same difference betweenpot and appliances.Am I not right?There are things you do not know.I started when I was ten years old.I'd keep an eye on theroad while playing soccer.I then started delivering merchandise.Then I started deliveringon a lager scale,in many areas.I would deliver anounce of pot for a shilling.I'd hide it in a loaf ofbread among 5 loaves.I'd give my mother the 4 loaves,and eat the one that had the pot myself.To keep this short,I then became a distributor.I started off with a few ounces,and became a big dealer eventually.My crew grew to a thousand men.You have descended upon us from nowhere.You're too haughty tosympathize with your customers.You'll never meet them or talk to them.Understand?You may be willing topoison people, but I'm not.I understand, but we'll need your boys.You don't speak to me like this.Listen, boy. Go and tell your bossesthat if they moveagainst me, they're dead.My fortune, or should I saywiseguy Yahya's fortune,had greatly increased. I wasone of Egypt's wealthiest men.My business had diversifiedinto many industrialand commercial ventures.And yet, I felt an emotional void.I had reached middle age, andI had never been in love.I made love manytimes, but never felt it.I was in a loveless marriage.I divorced Rabab with noregrets. We never had a child.This childlessnessreflected my double life.I wanted to be afather as officer Yahya,not as drug lord wiseguy Yahya.Hold the lift.I was no longer sureof my true identity.Was I really a police officer,or was I a drug lord?Did you see that girl?Find out everything about her.Farida was an architectand a college instructor.She graduated from Paris.Her office was in my building.The decrease of drugprices in the marketreflects a decreasein the risk of the trade.The percentage of confiscateddrugs has dropped to 3%.There are many new playersthat I have listed in a previous report.They are not traditional drug lords.They come from theworld of legal business.They have entered the tradefrom the top, not the bottom.This is unprecedented.A major shift isoccurring in the market.Finally, it has been yearssince I embarked on this mission.The people who assigned methis mission are no longer with us.I do not know who is incharge anymore.Therefore, I have an unusual request.I would like to meet myhandlers face to face.I have alluded to this in thepast, and received no answer.I am corresponding withpeople who are unknown to me.I feel like I am conversingwith a mute wall.I have started to wonder ifanyone is reading my reports,or if I have slipped through the cracks.To establish the meeting,I propose the following:A notice is to bepublished in the papersstating the following:You go down.Good evening.I am...I want to build a house.At this time of night?Isn't it too late?You see, the door was open, so...You're mister Yahya, right?Coffee?- Sure.- Give me a minute.I am done.A building, right?Anything.Anything?What do you feel like?You won't believe me.Perhaps a peasant's hut.Great.A peasant's hut it is.In such a posh area?Build whatever you want. Avilla, a castle, a mosque, a shelter.Whatever you want.Mister Yahya, what do you want?Nothing.What do you want to build?You decide.A small villa.The land is too large.A big villa, then.Do you think that this is my price?I wish you had one.It would be easy then.You're priceless.Those days, I felt a great vitality.A sun was shining brightand lighting up my life.I was in a peculiar state.I had carte blanche tocommit any act I wanted,including acts against laws andmorality. Only the mission counted.I bought and I sold. I seducedand I killed, and I got very rich.All this for one lofty goal.The goal absolved me of sinbut did not shield mefrom making mistakes.Therefore, committing sinswas easier than making mistakes.My isolation in the land of fearhad pushed me to ask for help.Just as I was losing hope, help came."To the one who wantsto reminisce over the past,""call this number".- Hello.- Moussa?I read the notice.- I'd like to meet.- What's you name?- Adam.- Understood.You're Adam from the old days?Yes. It's been 10 years now.Tell me more about yourself.I get so many calls from peoplewho want to buy and sell old watches.- I asked to meet because...- Never mind.How do we meet?Must we meet?I need to see you.Shall we meet in 2 hours? At 5:00?Do you know the Sultan Hassan mosque?You...You have kids?I'm sorry.Do not tell me anything.I don't want to know.What can I do for you?I want to make suremy reports are useful.I wouldn't know.How come?I know nothing. I want to know nothing.When I started the mission,I saw things clearly.I was sure of myself.Eventually,I started feeling like I waslooking through a glass.A layer of dirt startedforming on the glass,and it got thicker and thicker.I could not see anymore.Things got hazy.Memories...Mixed with dreams...Mixed with illusions...I've been having nightmares.I'd wake up in a panic.I feel doomed to loneliness.I'm hanging in the air. Myfeet can't touch the ground.I'm asking myself:What have I become?A killer, an outlaw.Everything I once despised, I've become.I accepted to become a criminal.If there's something I can do...I do not know what I can do.Is what I'm doing right or wrong?Is it of any use? Should I go on?These are questions I donot have the answer for.I'm not asking you.I'm asking the superiors.If you don't know, askthem for an answer.Ask them?I'll call you back.The meeting with Moussa troubled me.I was filled with suspicions.I started to feel as if Iwas living an illusion,as if the mission was afigment of my imagination.We hereby declare that lieutenant Yahyais working for the good of the nation.His mission is highly unorthodox.Beginning in the year...It shall last his entire lifetime.He has full amnesty. This includesprofits he makes during his mission.- Good morning.- Hello.- Coffee?- Sure.Didn't sleep either?Will you marry me?Sugar with your coffee?Will you marry me?I think not.I do not know you.You're rich, very rich.But who are you really?I do not know.You mind I'm rich?The design of the villawill be ready in 3 days.I'll stop by tomorrow.- Think about it.- I'm traveling later today.I think that Farida sensedthe paradox in my life.I longed for a simple life.A life with no secrets and no mystery.I was trying to flee thenightmare I was living.A contradiction between myfeelings, my actions, and reality.Welcome, sir. We are honored.The boss is expecting you.Mister Houdhoud.Follow me, please. Welcome.So nice to see you.I am glad you're here.I am honored by your presence.We're like brothers,though I knew youweren't going to visit.Once I knew you were nearby,I told the boys to fetch you.Forgive me.Where's your car?It's nearby.Good. If you'll allow it,ditch your car.We have special guests.If you don't mind,send your men away and stay here.Just do as I say.The police is about toraid the neighborhood.You go now.No just yet.We have time.Please.Please.Those are your men?They are all my men.Those who were caught,and those who weren't.God will provide.He provides for the bird in thesky, and the ant on the ground.He will provide for us too.The fisherman can't go homeempty-handed. The same with the police.They have to catch someone.Even the arrested ones,God will take care of them.Welcome, sir. We are honored.This is the house of theold man who was arrested.Mister Houdhoud? I want to sing,but I am ashamed.- Sing when my husband is in jail?- Sing, woman.Your husband was an ailing old man.I'll get you a younger one.Your daughter is gettingmarried next week?She was supposed to.She shall get married.I will take care of all expenses.She's like my daughter.Do not worry about a thing.I'll be a father to heruntil he comes back.Take this.God bless you. Goodbye.You barely ate a thing.What's wrong?You're tired.Tell me.You are a big boss,an important trader,a drug lord,but you're not at ease with it.You're like one swimmingin his business suit.It won't do.Each profession requiresa unique way of life.What to do?You can do a lot. Live your life.Swim with the current.Learn how to live.Are you married?Get married. Have children.Wanna get married now?- How?- Nothing to it.Go to Anawati.Tell him his daughteris getting married.The wedding is tonight.Let him fix her up.Tell him to come here.Get a priest too.Don't worry.It's all above board.You can divorce hertomorrow if you want.The dowry's 10,000.Plus 20,000 to terminate the marriage.Good morning, groom.- That was quite the trick.- Enjoy yourself.I'll have to leaveyou alone for a while.- I'll come with you.- Why don't you stay here?Where are you going?You want to come?When mister Yahya came,the whole place knew, right?Yes.Everyone thought heleft at nighttime, right?Yes.Except you and 3 others.Yes.How did the police find out then?I swear to God, boss...Watch out.Listen, son.The other 3 menwere locked up in a room.Here they are.They haven't been anywhere.You went home at night, which meansyou were the one who told the cops.Boss, I swear on the holy book...Shut up. Look here.You're still young. You're learning.This is the last time you do this.If you do it again,you're done for.Got it?You told them?Who did you tell? Alaa? Yousri?Be a man. Don't be scared.Tell me, damn you.Demote him to lookout.Salary of a boy.Who was it?Yousri?Why did you do it?Do you need money?Forgive me, boss.I owe everything to you.They said they'll pardon my brother.My mother cries all day long.- He might get the chair.- Damn you and your mother.The chair, you dog?Your brother is not worth the trouble.Move it. Shame on you.Go to the car. Get lost.Move it.See the disgrace?Killing one's own isthe hardest thing to do.Sometimes, we must kill.God created each of us for a purpose.He made us drug dealersto give pleasure to people.He made us rich.All this moneyis God's, not ours.We're just keeping watch over it.There are no roses with no thorns,no heaven with no hell.God assigned us certain duties,and burdens we must carry.He decreed that we sometimes must kill.I believe that killers get killed.I know I will be killed.That is the price that I must pay.Why are you crying?I love you.What?I love you.Why are you sad about it?Because...I know you will leave me.- What's your name?- Hana.Come.I knew you'd come.Nice roses.Hurt your finger?Did you sleep with someone?I haven't slept in 3 days.Look at the board.I knew you'd come.With every sound, I'dwonder if it was you.GREEK ISLANDS, 1982.You have nice taste, wiseguy.You're a sly fox.You lucky bastard.Why don't you pay attention?Please continue.What to do?What to do? Can't youkeep your boys in line?Shall I do it for you?What kind of boss are you?What can I do?My boys are being offered5 times what I pay them.That's not it.They're luring theboys with the product.Shall we assign guardsto keep watch on our boys?Powder is everywhere in the market.It has many customers.The dealers are a sight to behold.Clerks, college students,hair dressers. It's crazy.Some bosses.Lucky you. You can swim.- Why don't you?- He'd kill me.The first time he sawme, I was in a bikini.I was a flight attendant.It was in Paris.He saw me in a hotel.He thought I was a foreigner.He said in Arabic: "What a nice broad".I answered in Arabic.He was embarrassed.You never swim?I do, but not in front of the men.His first wife is there.She's a terror. Shegossips all day long.Is Yahya already married?That's crazy.Maybe he is.Don't worry about it.Watch out for him.You can't trust men.Excuse me.Isn't she ashamed? In front of the men?She's a tramp.You should blame her man.You know Omar Assyouti?I do.Know him well?We graduated the same year.He'll be in chargeof the anti-drug force.Can we bribe him?He's a good officer. He'll be a problem.Here's your wife.By the way, your wife is pregnant.Pregnant how?There's a baby in her belly.How do you know?Her father told me.- You mean Hana?- Yes. Who else?Your old wife.Why so quiet?Keep talking. What do you do anyway?What's funny?What do you think?I don't know.I'll tell you.I own a textiles factory.Also a leather shoes factory.A couple of cement plants.800 transport cars, 25 buildings,100 acres,and some villas.That's all, I think.Do you get it?I got it. It's clear.What do we do?You're drug dealers.Is she serious?Never leave the house alone.I'm assigning you 2 bodyguards.Skip work for a while.We're moving tomorrow.What is going on?What is going on? A power struggle.Who are you people?Who are you?A drug lord.The war started.It was unprecedented in the underworld.In addition to the massacre,Daldoul died, allegedly from suicide.I've never met a suicidal drug lord.Another drug lord disappearedon his way to his apartment.He left no trace.There is a cover-up, an attemptto hide the extent of the murders.The execution of these crimespoints to a sophisticated actor.In summary, this is a war toimpose heroin on the market.This war is being enabledby some powerful party.Adam.Welcome.We're honored.If we knew you're coming, wewould have rolled out the red carpet.I'm sorry I did not visit earlier.The men have something for you.Open it.2 million. We'd like some merchandise.What kind?Powder, of course. What else?You can keep the moneyuntil we deliver the drugs.There's no need.I appreciate it.We'll send you a batch for halfthe sum, and the rest in a month.The boss said you're not to leave alone.Can you step into the other car?- I'm taking this one.- They'll go with you.- I'm going alone.- Please, mam.Good morning.By the way, you can nowcome and go as you please.What if I escape?I'll find you.Stop being a child.I'm trying to protect youbecause I love you.Good morning.- How are you?- I'm working.What's this?A new car to replacethe one you wrecked.- Nice car.- Congratulations.Come on. Hurry up.Didn't you get it to sleep with me?Come on. Here I am.I knew that our relationshipsoured when she found out the truth.She asked for a divorce. I said no.I am sure that in a fewyears, who knows how many,she'll realize I did not deceive her,and that I lied when Isaid I was a drug lord.The police are herewith a search warrant.Let them in.The police are searching the office.Call me when they're done.Call the lawyer.Tell him to file a complaint.They want to search the car.The police increased its harassment.The periodic searches made me wonder.Was it the murders?Or Omar's recent appointment?- Find anything?- No.Dog.- Good evening.- Hello.Why is the door open?You know.Farida.I'm tired.I need you.You don't need anyone.Let go of me.Please.What have you done?I braced myself for the worse.It came faster than I thought.An arrest warrant.A message from the lawyer.- Officer Omar called him.- What for?He wants to meet you. Hepromises not to arrest you.Why?The lawyer asked.He said it was personal.What does he think?He's not sure. It's up to you.- I'll meet him in 2 days.- OK.Hello, Omar.So?Let's take my car to a public place.Shall we?Listen.If this is a trap, I will kill you.A trap? No.I made a promise.What is it?Doesn't Cairo look nice from up here?Just as we can see it,it can see us as well.What do you want?This is tedious.But I know this will pass.Nothing lasts forever.One day you will leave your post.That's true. I know.That's why I mustend you before I leave.You can't even manage to arrest me.I canceled the arrestwarrant. Here's the order.If somebody stopsyou, show this to them.You don't want money, I think.You know me well, and you cantell a clean cop from a dirty one.Am I corrupt?You are free.You no longer have anyissues with the police.Why?Look here.As we're talking, severalthings are happening.First, your men saw us sittingtogether with no protection.How would I trust you?Second, I canceled the arrest warrant.The news will be in the papers tomorrow.Third, the entire anti-drug task forceis raiding all the other drug lords.We've been planning this for 3 months.A lot of care has gone into it.Everyone except you.We won't get near you.How would this be interpreted?One more thing.All our informants willstart spreading a rumor:That you're the sourceof all our information.The rumor also says that youcontinue to collaborate with us.The price for yourcollaboration is known.Total amnesty.Got it?I'll let you be,but the drug lords won't.They will kill you.He's dead.To the cars. Quick.What is happening?It's all good.Who are you?Moussa.What do you do?I'm employed by the post office.- What?- The post office.- You're with the ministry of interior?- No.Intelligence?I am just a humblefunctionary in the post office.How about the justice ministry?No connections. My sonis trying to join though.Where do I come in?Why did you meet me?As I said, I work in the post office.About 15 years ago,I was assigned a task.I was to pick up messages from anaddress and deliver them to another.It was done by the book.I would clear themail just like any other.Upon delivery, I would get a receipt.This system worked for4 years without a hitch.I was then informed that thedestination address changed.I was given the new address.The missives continued to be delivered.I forgot one thing.I noticed that the letters allshared the same handwriting.They were all sent fromCairo, from different places.The letters were few and far between.- And then?- That's all.That system lasted 2 years.Then, once, we found the place closed.- What place?- The destination address.The letter was returned.We tried again. Again, no one was there.We first thought they wereaway on summer vacation.A whole year went by.I visited the district chief.God rest his soul. I told him about it.He told me that the letterswere a very high priority.He urged me to keeptrying to deliver them.Finally, one day, the mailmantold me he found the office open.The person in questionwas not there though.He had moved.Nobody knew where he went to.At that time, thedistrict chief had retired.I was not sure what to do,so I visited the director.He told me to follow regulations:Return the letters to the sender.But there was no return address.He told me to destroy them.- Did you do it?- No.I knew there was somethingspecial about those letters.It did not feel right to destroy them.What if the sender asked for them?I'd then be in trouble.I decided to keep them. Ipostponed destroying them.I tried my best to get more informationabout the sender, to no avail.Last year, I was promoted.I was torn on what todo with all the letters.I thought to myself,before destroying them,why not read them?I opened the first letter.It was strange.The name of the recipient was Moussa.Great God. My name is Moussa as well.I felt that it was more than acoincidence. It was destiny.Go on.I didn't understand the letter.I read the others. I didn't get a thing.I sensed it was importantthough. You wrote them, right?Go on.You know the contents, right?In the last letter, I found arequest to contact Moussa.I followed the instructions.God chose me to contact you.I said: "Let it be".I do not know why Godchose me for this mission.I put the notice, and you contacted me.I wanted to tell youeverything, but I couldn't.When you contacted me again,I decided to tell you everything.Can I help you in any way?So all this time, I waswriting the letters for you?I only meant well.This is a mosque.Get up.God is great...I won't kill you, butyou will do as I say.I want to help you.- Do you still have them?- Yes.Deliver the to the interior ministry,to Omar Assyouti, the anti-drug officer.Tell him everythingyou just told me. Got it?Show me your card.Is that your address?Yes, what else would it be?Still have the same phone number?Here. I swear to Godif you don't do as Isay, I will kill you.Understood?They've been interrogatingme for hours. I know nothing.You don't? How is that possible?I know just what I told you.I am just a messenger.I delivered the message,and told the truth.My only mistakewas that I read the letters,and sympathized with the sender.I believe you.Thank god.We need to know the sender.I don't know.I didn't want to know.Did you write those letters?Why would I do that?How would I know all this?I was just the messenger.Moussa died.I realized that I trulyadmired this simple man.He died before tellingme what Omar said.I was hounded by theentire drug world for weeks.My men all left me.Some fled, and others died.Wanna eat something?I'm not hungry.Hana.Tell Houdhoud I want to see him.He won't save us.Tell him I am on my way.Boss, be reasonable.I came to you.I am glad you did.I was afraid you'd die before I saw you.I want to know something.Did you kill Rajab and Ibrahim?Yes.Idiot.The first time we met Rajab,when Ibrahim brought him along,I glanced at you for a second.I saw true hate in your eyes.You hated him like death.A person hates death, and fears it,but respects it.But you hated Rajab,and despised him.I was surprised. I thoughtyou were odd.I started paying close attention to you.I felt you held many secrets within you.You were detached.The difference between youand me was that my long lifewas a burden for me.I couldn't just switch to their side.But you were a young, unburdened man.You could do it.You did what I wouldhave done if I was still young.You turned out to bean idiot, and I was foolish.What it the relationshipto what is going on today?You have the right to ask.The murder of Rajab andIbrahim is the source of it all.All you deserve now is abullet through the head.Those two were part ofworldwide organization.We're small fish.The big boys are abroad. They plant, andharvest, and manufacture, and export.We just distribute.Rajab and Ibrahim represented them.If they die, they're replaced.But if they're killed,their murderer must pay the price.I could not believe it whenthey told me it was you.I thought you were cunning.That was not cunning.Not cunning at all, mister wiseguy.I did not inform on anyone.I don't work for the police.The police wants toget us, and we hate it,but we understand each other.The story about you beingan informer was transparent.Any boss would haveunderstood the message though.What message?A message from above, from far away.They're saying they will notrest until you are annihilated.You have to die for us to live.It is an objective truth.I won't kill you.I don't know why. Maybe becauseI'm flawed.Only God is flawless.My flaw is that I loved you.My advice for you isto leave Egypt. Flee.They will not show mercy.If I see you again, I will kill you.I realized that my mission was over.It was time to depart the land of fear.It was time to go back to theold life I had almost forgotten."Amnesty also covers all the wealth he'saccumulated, regardless of the source"."The wealth may also beinherited by his descendants"."Signed by..."I can't believe this.You think I forged it?Maybe.What about Moussa?A crazy man. Let'sassume what you say is true.What difference does itmake? Your life is still in danger.You must change yourname and leave Egypt.You're a shrewd man with means.You know I'm right. Why not just do it?So die a drug lord?That does not matter.Just go abroad.And if I refuse?I'd have to arrest you onthe charge of dealing drugs.I'll share your document with mysuperiors. They'll decide what to do.I'll be in jail in the meantime?And by the time you'vedecided, I'd be dead.- That's it.- But why?Is it jealousy?Or don't you want to admit you failed?Or is it because Ibrahimand Rajab are dead?You know?You know why I won't kill you?I often doubted myself.Am I a policeman, oram I a drug lord now?The truth is that there is stilla small part of me that is a cop.Wiseguy Yahya is a druglord, no matter what they say.You killed, and you sold drugs.You're acting like Satan. When Godtold him to serve Adam, he refused,and became the devil.I wondered whether you'd try to kill me.My mission ended. The authoritiestold me my life was in danger.They assigned me abodyguard. Similar to Houdoud,they advised me to leave Egypt.I refused.One day, I met Farida on the street.I did not know she was back in Cairo.We met as strangers.We were curious aboutwhat had become of us.Still leaving the door open?We met often, as if we were encounteringeach other in a foggy world.Our relationship was going onaimlessly, with no end in sight.We did not know where we were going,or how it would end.I kept seeing Hana.I felt love for my son, Younis,in spite of our circumstances.I could not help but reminisceon the life of wiseguy Yahya,with sorrow and hopes.I discovered that I missed that lifein the land of fear.I wished I could go back.Farida came back to me.Caution and fear were my companions.I lived on,looking back fondly on the land of fear.SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
