(tense contemplative music)- [Narrator] For 100 years,we've been the guinea pigsin a grand experiment.Can managers, experts andbureaucrats more efficiently planand run our lives than we can?Does society flourishwhen a select few determinethe path for the many?Experts are critical toevaluating, judging, and planning,but shouldn't we be incharge of our own lives?(static hisses)- [Announcer] Let's startwith you and what you want.(soft bright music)What does anybody want?Millions have worshiped the strong man.Millions let somebody else decidewhat they want by fear, by force.(speaks in foreign language)(crowd yells)Yeah, a dictator.Over here, we don't like dictators.Our government represents us, the people.Our government is ourservant, not our master,and it makes a lot of difference to youwhat you can do and what you can't do.Limitations of our rights? Sure.But for the public good,and that's the way ourcountry has gone ahead.(static hisses)(contemplative music)- It was the year ofscience, turn of the century.Every day, new ideas came out.Society was changing much more rapidlythan it ever had before.An important figure was Speedy,Frederick Winslow Taylor.Speedy was his nickname,and Speedy was the great efficiency expertwho helped us to get the assembly line.- Industry was thisenormous thing that eruptedduring that time, and apparently,Taylor could improve productivity.(flames rumble)(muffled speaking)- He would observe industrial processes,and he would figure out howto make them more efficient.- [Narrator] The guy was obsessedwith scientific precision.His own peers called him authoritarianbecause he brought that obsessionwith precision into everything he did.He believed everything,especially factory work,could be perfected through science.- [Amity] One of the placesFrederick Taylor workedwas at Bethlehem Steel,where they were tryingto get more productivityout of a worker.- [Narrator] And asprovidence would have it,the Spanish-American War sparked a surgein demand for American steel.Large demand for steel meansBethlehem Steel Companymust move product,80,000 tons off the traincars and into the yard.In fact, they werestruggling in comparisonto other steel plants.The workers were already the lowest paidand likely a third as efficient.With a desperate need toimprove Bethlehem Steeland a theory that could change everything,this was Frederick's time to strike.- Frederick Winslow Taylor was the founderof scientific management.Why don't we figure outwhat's the one best way,the one best sequence ofactions to get this, that,or the other task donein this large factory?- Taylor believed that wecould all do things better,and that's fine, and factoriescould be more productive.Definitely true.But he also believed thatpeople need to be categorized.He actually said, "Some people are stupid.They're like oxen. Theyneed to work an ox's job.Other people are bright.They need their college men.They need to study theoxen and help the oxenand order the ox around."- So that was the principleof Taylorism is top down."Science is what makes mea legitimate authority,and you who don't have sciencemust be totally disempowered.You're just cluttering the system."- [Narrator] It was Frederick's theoryof scientific managementthat made this possible.Take any job and reduceit to its simplest,most efficient tasks, steps, and motions,and motivate the right personto work as efficiently as possible.Most of these men collapsedfrom working too hard and refusedto complete Taylor's firstexperiments in efficiency.Taylor later found one in particularwho could outperform the rest.A Pennsylvania DutchmanFrederick had nicknamed Schmidtwas all he needed to prove his theory.Frederick had Schmidt hustling upand down wooden planksto achieve his goal,and in a single day, Schmidt achievedwhat took the average workeran entire week's work.Taylor took backbreaking workand made it extremelyprofitable for his career.Taylor's cult of scientificefficiency was born.- [Amity] Taylorism was enormously popularbecause the early progressiveswere after progress.- [Narrator] Harvard, Penn State, Cornell,Purdue all converted his lecturesinto the world's first MBA programswhere influential intellectuals were eagerto impose an ideology that,not only can every cornerof society be planned and controlledfrom the top down, but that it must be.- The progressivesreally took this questionof national efficiency,and they took Taylor's ideasand they saw applicationsof those ideas well beyond the plant.Taylor himself says, "Wecan apply this not justto industrial management,but we can apply it to religion.We can apply it to private philanthropies.We can apply it to the farms."It was an economic idea,but then there were peopleduring The Progressive Erain the early 20th centurywho said, "This is anidea really that appliesacross a whole range ofthings, including politics."- The progressives were oneof the first intellectualmovements that viewed societyas a big company, let's say,or just a big organizationthat needs to be managed.- Taylorism then becamethe idea that the expertcan come along, tell thenon-expert how to do it,whatever it might be.- It essentially believedthat if you had enough scienceand enough power, you couldfix the human condition.(dark brooding music)- I think Taylor's ideas led directlyto the enshrinement of expert government,the idea that experts should be involvedin making all of the decisions.- [Narrator] Everything we do suddenlyrequires more scientificmanagement. Personal hygiene,diet, child rearing, housing, posture,recreation, family structure.- And I think the 20thcentury took that modelinto its politics.- [Narrator] Government control.- The idea is that that we human beingsare there to be controlled,and there is a scientificway for us to be,and then they use this informationwhen making their directives to us.They issue their commands basedupon what they've learned.That's the big mistake.That's the category mistake.A country is not a company.- [Narrator] And we would continue to readwhat the world's firstmanagement expert sowed.Within a few decades ofFrederick's experiments,the consent of the government was aboutto be delegated to the experts.Revolution had ripped through Russia,and Vladimir Lenin had aworm in his stomach for more,but food and power were scarce,and things were only getting worse.Having lost many skilledworkers during the Revolution,he needed a system that couldturn malnourished peasantsinto red-blooded factory workers.Lenin's solution was a managerial economy.- It must have dawned onhim how congenial that wasto that entire structurethat he had erectedof political power.The Communist party is theultimate Taylorist organization.If you ever saw how thingsworked in the Soviet Union,to the bitter end,it was this little groupof people take over,and they, through scienceand expertise and technology,dominate everybody else.- [Narrator] When Stalintook Lenin's seat of power,the Soviet Russia representedthe ultimate expressionof Frederick Taylor's idea,a complete scientifically managed state.The promise ofscientifically precise orderand efficiency excited them,but they weren't the only ones.- American progressivesweren't getting very farwhen it came to politics in the 1920s.Nobody was paying attention to them,and they wanted to be admired,and over in the Soviet Union,larger scale experiments weregoing on, and at one point,Soviet leaders invitedAmerican progressives,particularly people in theunion movement, to come overand admire the Soviet Unionfor a fancy junket trip.- [Narrator] Basicallya glorified field tripto admire the Soviet Union's achievementsup close and personal.- In 1927, a group ofprogressives went to Russia.They went over on a boatcalled the Roosevelt,named after Theodore Roosevelt.- [Narrator] Stalin's guestlist included an assortmentof journalists, intellectuals,and labor leaders.Among them were two fanboysof Taylor's writings,Rexford Tugwell, an economistwho saw a great needto reform American agriculture,which he believed was tooinefficient and wasteful,and Stuart Chase, a socialtheorist who believedthat engineers should bein charge of governmentand run society like a machine.Both saw much potentialin the centralized economyof the Soviet experiment,and the timing of their visitcouldn't have been better.But even with a generous audience,Soviet leaders still had a lot to hide.- You're not getting recognition at home.You think you deserve recognition.You go over to Russia andthey unroll the red carpet.(dramatic music with Russian vocals)(dramatic music)- [Narrator] What they didn't knowwas that Stalin meticulouslyplanned every detailof their tour, the factories, the farms,all carefully staged for themlike a perfectly scripted Disney ride.They saw a lot of Russiabut only the Russiathat Stalin wanted them to see.- Russia put on a good showfor these Americans to impress them.They built a modern Potemkin village,a fake Russia to show the travelers.They showed them only the good parts.They sat them down with pretty girls.They made sure they had a good time,and they hid the bad parts,the Soviet government andthe Soviet trade unions,from these visitors.- Of course, what they'renever shown are the gulagsand the execution chambersand the torture chambersand all these things,and only educated Western intellectualscould be stupid enough to believe the kindof Kabuki theater thatthey were being presented,either by Stalin's Russia or anyone else.- They were thinking aboutwork and labor productivityand the American worker andthe Soviet worker, but Stalin,he was talking past them.He was really grandstanding 'cause then hecould say an interviewwith the United States,and he needed what?Western currency.Russia was actually desperatebecause the Soviet experimentwas actually already failing.It needed America and itneeded American recognition.- [Narrator] And if youimpress these intellectualsand labor leaders, you'lllegitimize the Soviet Unionand create diplomatic ties.By the end, the junketleft Russia ironicallyon a ship called Leviathan,stuffed to the brim with hopesof spreading the dream of a reimagined,fully managed, centrallyplanned United States.- There was always a kindof fascination with Marxismand Marxism, Leninism amongAmerican intellectual leftists,and so a certain predisposition to believethat America could learnfrom Soviet Russia,that the Soviet experiment was working.- They all left with one big impression."I can have more authority.I can have more power'cause the Russians do.Look, they run the economy.I could do it, too."Americans were all interestedin the Soviet experiment.I've seen the future and it works.- [Narrator] Journalistsat The "New York Times,""The New Republic,"and other news sources werebreathlessly favorable.These voices of the media werewhat the Americans trusted,both working class andpolitical elites alike.Walter Duranty, The "New YorkTimes" Russia correspondent,was especially helpful inpushing a utopian narrativeabout the Soviet Union.- Walter Duranty, who lateremerged when you read the copy,is an apologist forSoviet abuse, for murder,who helped to cover up the evilthat was happening in the Soviet Union.- [Narrator] It turns out,after winning a Pulitzerthat much of what he reportedabout the Soviet Unionwas, quote, "some of the worst reportingto appear in this newspaper."Those are their words, not mine.By the time the truthof what was happeningin the Soviet Union finallybegan to surface in the '30s,the misinformation and propagandahad already taken rootin many people's minds.Duranty's influence was cementedas soon as he won the Pulitzer Prize.Nevermind the cover upsover mass starvation.He had the ear of the peopleand of elites likeFranklin Delano Roosevelt,and when FDR won thepresidency a few years later,he'd bring along two gentlemenwho saw the Russian experiment firsthand.They became a part ofFDR's group of advisors,the Brain Trust,and the Brain Trust had some new ideasfor how to cure The Great Depression.- [Announcer] And here it is,the beginning of the greatestdrama in American affairs,the creation of a new chief executive.Roosevelt is the nation's idol here today.Thousands of Americans arehere to cheer the birthof a new era in nationalaffairs, a New Deal era,which is supposed to pullthe country out of its chaos.- I am prepared undermy constitutional dutyto recommend the measuresthat have stricken the nationin the midst of a strickenworld may require fraud,executive power to wage awar against the emergency.This nation is asking foraction and action now!(audience applauds)(tense music)(triumphant marching music)(flames crackle)(slow dramatic music)- [Joseph] The circumstancesunder which Franklin Rooseveltenters office in 1933,the country's really in a chaotic state.The stock market crash happens in 1929.It's been going on now for several years.- [Amity] Unemployment was over 20%.We had a national emergency.People actually were starving.- [Joseph] The Great Depressionreally put so many peoplein America on the edge of subsistence,and so this created a situationwhere people were willingto turn to whatever solutionsthey thought might work.They were desperate forgovernment to do something.- The Great Depression and the electionof Franklin Roosevelt in1932 presented progressiveswith a priceless opportunity to putinto practice theiroptimistic hopes for the powerof government to solvesocial and economic problems.The Harding and Coolidgeadministrations dismantled muchof the machinery of governmentthat had built up particularlyduring the First World War,and Roosevelt was certain thatif he had the opportunity,he would rebuild it in a waythat it couldn't be torn down.♪ All the world on the way to the ♪- [Narrator] And Roosevelt pledgedto strike a New Dealfor the American worker.In other words, "I know you're suffering,and I have a plan that will fix it.Trust me."The predominant view in theBrain Trust was that the marketwas too unstable, tooinefficient, and wasteful.This depression could only betamed by expert bureaucrats.- These were people basicallyin the Roosevelt administrationwho weren't necessarily politicians.They were experts.Roosevelt really embracesthe idea of expert governmentthat his Brain Trust isstarting to pitch to himas the future of American government.- [Steven] Franklin Rooseveltand the other New Dealerswere enormously critical of the wasteand inefficiency offree market capitalism.- Now we have an industrial economywith advanced things likerailroads and telephone.So the world's changed.So we need to directthings from Washington.That was the mindset thatRoosevelt and his Brain Trust had.They were smarter than the rest of us.- Franklin Roosevelt had tremendous faithin experimentation as a meansof solving social problems.(contemplative music)And he says in one of his speeches,"We should try something.Just try it, and if it doesn'twork, try something else,but above all, try something."(muffled shouting)- If we would keep faith,if we would make democracysucceed, I say we must act now!- [Narrator] Roosevelt'sgovernment descendedon the country in militaristic fashion,waging more on this economic beastand claiming all the executivepower that comes with it,creating a bunch of new agenciesthrough a compliant Congress.- And it's really thosefirst couple of yearsof Roosevelt's presidencywhere the most audaciousand wide-rangingcentralized planning effortswere attempted.- The centerpieceof the New Deal was an administration,the National Recovery Administration,that regulated business across the board,including in very confusing ways,such as how many chickens achicken seller could sell,what price something might be.- [Narrator] Hundreds of new lawsregulating every littledetail you can think of,the precise components of macaroni,the price a tailor couldcharge for sewing a button.Consumers can no longerpick their own chickens.And the point of all of this wasto bring the runaway economyunder rational expert control.- This was basically amandate to the president,the ability to restructure competitionacross the entire country.- [Narrator] And on the heelsof the NRA came the AgriculturalAdjustment Act, the AAA.More regulation.The Brain Trust believedthat government expertise,not the free market,could dictate the economyby artificially controlling prices.- The idea of scientificmanagement is clearlywhat leads to theAgricultural Adjustment Act,and the basic notion is we needto make sure that the farmsaren't producing too much foodbecause once that happens,the prices of all of thecommodities will go down,and that will put thefarmers out of business.- [Narrator] The AAAturned over any surplusof food to the government.So now with millions of starving Americansand a government that ownsa surplus of commoditiesthat could solve thatproblem, what did they do?They destroyed it. Dairiesdumped milk into the sewers.Train loads of orangeswere soaked in kerosene.Businesses shuttered, andpeople continued to starvebecause Roosevelt's inner circleof experts knew what was best.- [Joseph] We need to planagricultural productionso that the farmers produce less foodso that their prices can say highso that they can stay in business.- Suddenly, businesses were saying,"This New Deal does not work out for us.There are too many rules.They're meant to help my business,but actually, they hurt my businessand keep recovery far away from me."(soft ethereal music)- And the New Deal really isthe full emergence of this ideaof centralized planningby administrative experts,and I think the American people were readyto take that direction from the governmentbecause they were afraidfor what was happeningin terms of their own familiesand their own futures.All of Roosevelt's policiesreally didn't do muchto end The Great Depression.The Depression continued for many years.- That is why I am asking theworker of America to go alongwith us in a spirit ofunderstanding and of helpfulness.- [Narrator] Despite theTrust's best thinking,planning, and experimenting,the Depression was refusing to disappear.The New Deal tested thelimits of executive authority,and the Brain Trust provedthat any government,given the right crisis, cantransform a country completely,sometimes for good andsometimes for the worst.(triumphant music)It was 1934. One in fiveAmerican workers were unemployed.The experts who staffedPresident Roosevelt'snew National RecoveryAdministration believed theycould end The Great Depressionby writing strict newregulations for the market.- Franklin Roosevelt and theother New Dealers believedthat they could solve theproblems of those industriesand therefore solve the problemsof American economic lifethrough the application of technicaland scientific expertisewithin the government.- Nobody knew what the New Deal would be,but what it did prove pretty fast to bewas a threat to small business,particularly the NationalRecovery Administration,which had a lot of codes that made it hardfor business to operate.- [Narrator] But Americans quickly souredon the National RecoveryAdministration's overbearingand ineffective bureaucracy.- And the way it all came to a headwas through a chicken business,chicken butchers in Brooklyncalled the Schechters.- [Narrator] The Schechterbrothers were Jewish immigrantswho ran a kosher chicken business.Unlike the economistsat the National Recovery Administration,the Schechters wereuneducated working class men,but they knew the poultry business.Their last name Schechterwas an occupational surname derivedfrom the Hebrew word for slaughter.- So these Schechters,it was in their culturefor their customers, restaurants,or sometimes individuals,to pick their chickens.You wanted to be able to pickwhich chicken you were buying'cause you wanted a healthy,not a tubercular, chicken.It was the culture of themarketplace that they came from.They were religious Jews.They sold kosher chickens.It was very important for their customersto have chicken choice.- [Narrator] But accordingto the National Recovery Administration,customers weren't supposedto choose their own chickens.NRA inspectors wrote up the Schechterson 60 code violations,including some criminal charges.In addition, the Schechtersallegedly violated NRA codesthat set worker hourspay, and chicken prices.- New Deal comes along andsays, "You're breaking the law.We're gonna charge you.You might go to jail."(slow dramatic music)They find themselves on thestand, count after countagainst them, beingprosecuted by the governmentfor violating New Deal law.And in the arguments by the attorneys,what you can feel is thearrogance of the expertise.The lawyers who were prosecutingthe little chicken dealersreally explicitly berated them.They said, "How dareyou presume to tell mewhat a chicken's price must be?Only experts can say that.If you had studied agricultural economics,you would be an expert, butyou're not an economist.You're just a little chicken dealer."So you see that clashso clearly in this case,the expert book learning versusthe expert, the common man.- [Narrator] The caseof Schechter PoultryCorporation v. United Stateswent all the way to the Supreme Court.On May 27th, 1935,the Supreme Court handeddown its decision,a unanimous victory forthe Schechter brothers.- Sometimes it's referredto as Black Monday,the day that the SupremeCourt said that the New Dealand major components ofit were unconstitutional.- [Narrator] The NationalRecovery Administration was dead.It should have proved tothe Roosevelt administrationthat their experts couldn'tregulate the economy backto health, but FDR didn'tgive up on managerialism,and eventually, the SupremeCourt upheld many other programsof the New Deal, programsthat may have actuallyextended The Great Depression.- Louis Brandeis, one of thepeople who brought the ideasof scientific managementinto the public square,was now on the Supreme Court,and he was part of that Supreme Courtthat handed down these decisions sayingthat the New Deal was unconstitutional.- [Narrator] Years earlier,Brandeis helped make the fatherof managerialism,Frederick Winslow Taylor,a household name.Brandeis was the onewho told Taylor in 1909to call his system scientificmanagement, but now,Brandeis was saying thatFDR had crossed a line.- It's a peculiar historical fact, right?That people credit FDRwith rescuing Americansfrom The Great Depression.Anyone who knows anyhistory at all knows that wewere still in a deeply depressedstate in the late 1930s.The evidence is overwhelmingly clearthat he didn't save Americansfrom The Great Depression.He extended the length of the Depression.- [Narrator] Meanwhile,what happened to the Schechter brothers?The government's persecutioncost them everything.The Schechters spent everynickel they had on their case.Their poultry business,which was doing $20,000of business every weekbefore the New Deal,went down to $2,000 a weekand then went out of business.On the year anniversaryof the Schechter Supreme Court victory,The "New York Times" reportedthat the entire Schechterfamily was virtually penniless.The Schechter case was a momentarydefeat for managerialism,but there were still plenty of expertsin the government that were certain theycould regulate their wayto a more perfect America.- What is an expert?Is it someone with practicalexperience in a certain field,or is it someone with book learning?The man with experience,the regular person,was insufficientlyrespected by the New Deal,and we can experiment withpeople because we're clever.We're professors and theyneed us. There's an emergency.The patient is dying on thetable, the U.S. economy.Let's operate on his heartbecause we are surgeonswho know better than everyone else.- [Narrator] After World War II,a new president wouldlaunch his own expansionof expert rule which hecalled the Fair Deal.Expert economic planninghad taken a major hitin the Schechter case,but what about expert housing planning?(soft ethereal music)(audience cheers)The purview of expertadministration grew bit by bit.It all startedwith Woodrow Wilson'ssupposedly modest effortto offload the minute detailsof government administration,from Congress to disinterestedand efficient expertsuntil FDR's New Deal.Now a public that hadendured a Great Depressionand a Second World Warwas growing accustomedto centralized federal power.Six years of war dramaticallytransformed the U.S. economyand many of its cities.This brought waves ofmigration into cities,and that unsurprisingly broughtits own housing challenges.So how does the federal governmentsolve a problem like housing?Simple, by throwing moneyand expertise at it.President Truman tooka page from FDR's bookand unveiled a Fair Deal agenda,which included the Housing Act of 1949.The FHA poured money into urban renewaland slum clearance projects.The government's expertsbelieved that slumscould be replaced with highly efficient,self-sustaining public housing.- The beginning of the GreatSociety was urban renewal,building tall towers to house peopleon the principle We knewhow to house people.- [Narrator] Perhaps noproject was more ambitiousthan St. Louis's Pruitt-Igoe Complex.A massive stretch ofdowntown was completely razedto make room for it, entireneighborhoods erased.Up and coming architect Minoru Yamasakiwas selected to design the buildings.Yamasaki was highly influencedby a French architect named Corbusier.Corbusier was a huge fan ofFrederick Winslow Taylor,and Taylor's principles ofefficiency imbued his work.Yamasaki wanted to try somethingsimilar for Pruitt-Igoe.Architecture magazines ravedabout his initial designs.Skip stop elevators stoppedon every third floor.The idea was both tomaximize the number of unitsand to foster a sense of communityby encouraging interactionbetween neighbors,and although he preferreda mix of building sizesrather than strictly high rises,St. Louis officials said no.- [Amity] He had to work for government,and government said, "Well,this is too expensive.You have to make this housing more dense."- [Narrator] Reluctantly,Yamasaki did it their way,and up the towers went.- 33 Towers, 11 stories each,and the premise was people live in slums.Let's move them into something nice,an animal farm in the city, right?Pruitt-Igoe. These towers are clean.They have all sorts of amenitiesthat the homes thesepeople live in don't have.They're gonna be happier,and progress will ensue.- So we'll take these people,raze all these private homes,create the modern towers.Just the fact that they'rein this modern gleaming placeis going to engenderfeelings in the residents(lawnmower hums)that are gonna lead to utopia.Well, what happens is the exact opposite.(dramatic music)- [Narrator] It's hardto find the right wordfor what happened next, tragedy, disaster.St. Louis officials assumedthe city's populationwould keep growing.It did not.The same FHA money thatallowed for the constructionof the complex also subsidizedsuburban home ownership.Whites left the city in droves,making the complex de facto segregated.(film reel clicks)(tense music)There weren't enough peoplewilling to live in the towers,which again were designedto have maximum occupancyso that the collectedrent would cover upkeep.Many of the residentsreceived government benefits,so they paid a much lower rate.Under Missouri law,welfare benefits camewith a brutal requirement.A family could only haveone parent, a mother.The government was paying mothersto kick fathers out of their homes,disproportionatelywrecking black families.Upkeep quickly unraveled as therewasn't enough moneygenerated to pay for it.But Yamasaki's designsbear some blame as well.- Because people couldn't get offon their floor through the elevator,they had to go on the stairs,and muggers came and mugged them there.No one wants to go up and down stairs'cause that's where the muggers go.It was true, and Pruitt-Igoebecame very dangerous.- [Narrator] Lightfixtures in the breezewayswere constantly being smashed,leaving nightmarishly dark holeswhere the worst of thingscould and did happen.- This glorious national symbolof a public housing project,instead of becoming heaven, became helland was eventually dynamitedin a very sad and dramatic session.So instead of buildingthe future American home,we put people in prisons.That's what Pruitt-Igoe was.It was universally hatedby a proud city, St. Louis.It's still a scar on the cityscape.- The people had no voice on it.Science as interpreted by the politiciansin the 20th century tookon an arrogant edge to it,and, of course, that meantthe rule of the experts,the rule of the scientists.(slow dramatic music)We don't know enough.We know a lot, but we don't know enough.- [Narrator] Nobody took the failure moreto heart than the architect Yamasaki.He expressed regret forhis deplorable mistakeswith Pruitt-Igoe.By the 1950s, he wasgiving bitter speechesabout the tragedy of housing thousandsin exactly lookalike cells,which certainly does not foster our idealsof human dignity and individualism.To the Detroit Free Press,he put it more simply."Social ills can't becured by nice buildings."The final towers were demolishedon spectacular displayin 1976.With them should have gone the hubrisof centrally planned government, but alas.What did government do instead?We launched the GreatSociety, the next New Deal.Early progressives wereinterested in efficiency,in making government more efficientthrough expert administration.They hated wastefulness.Their solution was to runsociety like an engineer.To them, political sciencecould replace politics.The New Deal was justapplying that principle.Centralize as much power over the economy,over housing, over business as possible.The Supreme Court may havereined FDR's program in,but the administrative statehe helped construct continuedto grow in size and scope anyhow.When Lyndon Johnson announceshis Great Society initiative,the goal of this administrativestate is no longer justabout expert control over the economy.It's far deeper.- So Lyndon Johnson's GreatSociety was an attempton the one hand to harness New Deal,progressive-style government,faith in expertise,the attempt to ameliorate the problemsof modern capitalistindustrialist society.We're not just going to throwmoney at the poor and say,"Okay, we've provided a safety net.We're going to end poverty."And you think about howradical that really is.We're gonna transform the human condition.- And this administration today hereand now declares unconditionalwar on poverty in America.- Poverty has been with human beingssince human beings began toexist, and we're gonna fix that.We, in our time in 1960s America,have the wealth and theresources and the expertiseto transform the human condition,to permanently end the problem of poverty.We have the ability in this time, not justto solve man's material needs, but alsoto solve man's culturaland spiritual longings.We are going to fulfillthe longings of the soulthrough expert government programs.We're going to bring thecity of God down to earth.- [Narrator] Utopia was within reach.All that was required wasenough managerial powerin the hands of the right people.- So we get food stampsas a new entitlement.We get the expansion of Social Securityto include Medicare and Medicaid.We get increased housing assistance.- [Narrator] Urban renewalefforts like Pruitt-Igoewere a flat-out disaster that left citiesin worse shape than they'd seen before.Even the more successfulprograms fell wildly shortof Johnson's goals.Shortly after healthentitlements were introduced,it became clear that therewere crucial gaps in coverage.High prices to taxpayers and lossesthrough bureaucraticinefficiency and fraudquickly bred increasedgovernment dependencewith an ever increasingburden on taxpayers,which caused backlash bya disillusioned public,but the damage was done.- By the latter half of the 20th century,all the intellectual foundationsfor, and the framework of,the justification forthe administrative statehad been put in place, andit had, for better or worse,been widely accepted by the general publicand by the political class.- [Narrator] But that wasnot the original pitchfor the American republic.At least FDR pressureda compliant Congressinto signing legislationfor his ambitious programs.With the Great Societyand greater expansionof government power over our lives,this whole three branchesof government thingwas getting tossed right out the door.- Republics are based on the ideathat we elect people who make the laws,but most of the laws todayaren't made by Congress.Most of the laws today are madeby administrative agencies.(muffled speaking)The rules and regulations that are madeby the national governmentare made in EPA, at FDA,at the FTC, at the SEC,and all of the alphabetsoup agencies that we knoware the real governinginstitutions in America today.(soft ethereal music)(camera shutter clicks)- [Narrator] Woodrow Wilsonopened a fourth branchof government, expertadministrators who would dealwith all the little details of regulationthat Congress neither had the timenor the expertise to handle themselves.But this fourth branch wasovertaking the other three.- It now exercises all threepowers of the other branches,which is a big no no under theidea of separation of powers,which is a key component ofour constitutional system.- The promises that Lyndon Johnson madeabout what government coulddo for them were unbelievableand, in the end, unattainableand have fueled the perceptionthat government makes promisesthat it can't keep that,that we should be cynical about governmentbecause government is a disaster,government can't do the thingsthat it's supposed to do.It makes promises and doesn't keep them.- [Martin] What happenedin the 21st centuryis a sudden realization by the publicthat they were in somewhatof a parallel positionto the worker in the factory floor.Don't think, right?Because the experts know.- [Narrator] The expertsknow more than you doabout what's good foryour personal nutrition.They know better than you doabout how to keep us all safe.They know better thanyou about your finances.They know how to protect the environment.They know how to protect your health.- [Don] What the COVID episodeshowed is that a free peoplecan indeed be made so scaredthat they are willing,in fact eager, to give up their freedoms.- The COVID pandemic reallyhighlighted the abilityof scientific expertsto abuse their powers.- [Martin] The governmentthought it knew more than it didand then demonstrated it knewless than it thought, okay?- The idea that government in an emergencyshould respond rapidlyto deal with a crisis,that's always been partof American government,but what's new is theauthority of the scienceand the authority of the scientiststo command our allegiance.All of our decisionswere going to be basedon a model produced byexperts inside the governmentwho could predict with much more accuracythan they actually can what would happenif you just follow their orders.- When COVID came along,Anthony Fauci first said this,and then he said the opposite,and CDC stood in the wayof developing a vaccine,and there were all thesemoments where the peoplein charge seemed to be morethe problem than the solution.- It soon came to be takenby the general publicand by the political elitethat they were the experts,and any questioning ofthat was to deny science.- We should alwaysremember Richard Feynman'swonderful definition of science."Science is the belief thatthe experts are wrong."Science is aboutcontestation, not orthodoxy.- The lesson that I draw from the effectsof the administrative stateis that it's a bad deal.- America's in the midstof a really central momentin its history where,on both sides of the political spectrum,there's an increasing distrustof the people in power.I think we do need torethink the foundationsof modern administration.We need to restore someidea of an administrationthat is in our control.- We need experts. We need expertise.The issue is, will experts have power?Value expertise but fear expert power.- [Steven] We actually haveto have the power to say yesto this expert, no to this other expert.- If we want a true ruleof experts, in my view,it would be to decentralizedecision makingas much as possible.No one is more expert inwhat is good for me than me,and I have an incentive to get it right.Don Boudreaux is theworld's leading experton Don Boudreaux.- [Narrator] For 100 years,we've been the guinea pigsin a grand experiment.Can managers, experts, andbureaucrats more efficiently planand run our lives than we can?Does society flourish when aselect few determine the pathfor the many?The time for hypothesizing, theorizing,and moralizing is past.The data is in, and it is overwhelming.No matter how knowledgeable,the consolidation of powerin the hands of the fewhas harmed the governedevery time it was tried.Experts are critical toevaluating, judging, and planning.But if losing our freedom isthe cost of trusting anything,is it really worth it?- Things have gotten bad,people are suffering,but it's up to us.I would like us to returnour autonomy to the people.That we can do, but wehave to choose to do it.It's not easy.(dramatic music)It's not clear how you unwindthe administrative state,but it can be done, and it must be done.(tense contemplative music)
