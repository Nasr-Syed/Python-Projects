You haven't killed anyone yet.Kill me now and inherit allof the Iga ninja's fighting spirit.Father!Father!Behead me, Hanzo!Bring my head to theHanzo Gate and display it!Hang it high on the Hanzo Gate.Don't hesitate!Behead me quickly, Hanzo!Do it now!Father!Do a good job, Hanzo!I have never forgotten myfather even for a moment.I will avenge myself onthem in my own way.The best way is to pair upwith someone in the Shogunate.But you might parallelour predecessor.I am different from himand I am sure I will succeed.Won't you lend a hand?I'm content to be a thief.I will go my own way.Suit yourself.Hey, won't you come to my place?Kohagi will be happy to see you.Some other time.I have got something to do.I also have many followerswith the same aim in life.Earn five ryo per head today.I will make 10 ryo...Have a nice day.We are off!What's wrong, Koroku?They are all gone.Why are you still here?Go quickly, Koroku!What's the idea?Don't!Stop it. Please!Koroku, no! Please!Stop it!You fool! Stop it!Stop it, Koroku! Please!Please!What's wrong?Tell me what is wrong.I wet my pants!No!

He is trying to speak!Did you hear that?He is Lord Naito!He must be out of his mind.Move away!Unfasten the fetters!We shouldn't have done that, Chief.The cops are making afrantic search for the culprit.Chief!He is right.We had better leave Edo now.Don't talk such nonsense!We will be arrested soon.Tens of thousands ofpeople live in this town.That's why we are safe here.That's right.We are safe as long aswe slip in among the crowds.I don't mind moving outif you feel uneasy here.Open the window, Koroku.I have been unhappywith that a long time.The sight of the castlecuts me to the quick.Let's move out!We are moving out, Koroku.Go to Upper Hanzo’s.Brother!Okay?Go to Upper Hanzo!Go on!Kohagi!Who sent you here?My brother told me to look after you.What a man!Can I stay?Look Kohagi...This isn't a place for a woman.300,000 ryo is anexorbitant sum of money.Even leading Edo merchants likeus cannot raise the money easily.You must do it.How long do I have?Within three days.That's impossible!Do you want to see hardheadedLord Aizu come to power?He will issue a regulation on debtcancellation once he comes to power.Under the regulation, people willbe entitled to cancel their debts.He's even planning to restrict theprices of rice, salt and lumber.But, if I come back to power,there will be no problems for you.I don't think the 300,000 ryois too much for that.All right, Sir.What are you planning todo with the 300,000 ryo?How you are going to contributethe money is written here.100,000 ryo to Lord Mito.30,000 ryo to Lord Kishuand Lord Owari respectively.25,000 ryo to Lord Sakai.25,000 ryo to Lord li.25,000 ryo to Lord Izu Matsudaira.Eat it up!25,000 ryo to Lord Iga Naito.20,000 to Lord Abe.20,000 to Lord Nagai.Is that all?We will manage it.Is the chief in?He is upstairs.Where do we go next?Wealthy merchants will delivertheir money to some lords for Izu.So we will steal it.That sounds interesting.But this job won't be easyas our previous jobs were.What do you mean2I met the monster at Izu's mansion again.Is he a Koga Ninja?Yeah, his gang will be on the alert in anticipation of our attack.We will have to beat them for Iga's honor.Fight to the death.Come up, everybody.You idiot!
