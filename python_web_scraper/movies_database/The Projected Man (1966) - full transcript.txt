(suspenseful music)(pleasant music)(ominous music)(tires screeching)You want to watch where you're going!Pretty you may be.(car engine rumbling)Dr. Hill?[Blonde Woman] Yes.Professor Steiner is expecting you.I'm Sheila Anderson, thedepartment secretary.Would you come in here, please?(knocking)Dr. Hill, Professor Steiner.Come in, come in.Oh, it's wonderful to see you again.And piggy to you.I do apologize.On the spur-of-the-moment,I could think of noother code name for youto give to the guards.That wasn't what I meant.You haven't changed.Seeing you standing thereas if the years had suddenly dropped away.Paul, that was a long time ago.What's the problem that youwant to discuss with me?(sighing)Oh, thank you, Miss Anderson.Oh, Miss Anderson, is Dr. Mitchel in?Yes sir, he went into the lab.Would you ask him to set up a test run?I'll be along presently.At once, sir.I'm working on theconversion of solid objectsinto pure energy.Energy which can be storedin a cell composition,projected over long distancesand then turned backinto the object again.All kinds of objects,including human tissue.Human tissue?Yes.Television!Television is one method oftransferring a visual imagefrom one place to another.But the image is flat, two-dimensional,lacks life and needs a receiver.What I have achievedis the projection of anobject in three dimensions,something that has weight, depth and bodyand without a receiver.Yesterday,I achieved my first projectionof a living creature.Unfortunately, something went wrongand the subject died.For how long did it live?Oh, two to three minutes.I want you to tell me why it died.Whether there was any changein the cellular structureduring projection.What I need to correct.What's the principle that you employ?I'll show you.Come with me.Mitchel?I'd like you to meet Dr. Hill.She'll be joining us on our project.You could say we met before.Well, almost.Mitchel is an expert on laser.I'm afraid I know very little about it.Oh,well then fit her out with a heat suit,explain it to her and I'llgo set up the console.There?Professor Steiner?I had to tell Dr. Blanchardyou wanted another experimental run.And?He's given his permissionon this occasion.In the future he requires 24 hours notice.And you've been instructedto see that he gets it?I have.Dr. Blanchard's the directorof this foundation, isn't he?You can say that again.I'm in the middle.You were going to tell me about laser.Sorry.Well, I expect you know it's a way ofovercoming a scattering of light waves.In it's simplest form, weput an electric currentthrough a mixture ofneon and helium gases.Now the light is amplified and emitted,it becomes a coherent source of power.You mean it doesn't gooff in all directions.Exactly.It's one very narrow beamthat can transmit more signalsthan all the television andradio channels put together.It's light in a new form,which I have modified totransmit matter itself.(machinery buzzing)Now I'd like to demonstratewith something of your own.Something you'd recognize.My watch do?Couldn't be better.Come with me.(machinery humming)This is the transmission cradle.It creates a massive magnetic field.Now, the watch.Now, put your visor on and stand back.But keep your eye on the watch.(machinery buzzing)What has happened at this stageis that the basic matter of the watchhas been transformed into pure energyand is stored over there in that cell.Forever, if necessary.Now, we wish to transmit that energyto project the watch, in fact.(machinery humming)Laser preheat.[Chris] Laser preheat in.(buzzing)[Paul] Laser emission relay.Laser emission relay...On.(electrical pulsing)Relay one.Relay on in.(machinery ringing)Relay two.[Chris] Relay two, on.(machinery ringing)Project.(fizzling)Now,we'll see what happened to your watch.(machinery powering down)It's incredible.I succeed every timewith an inanimate object.If only I could do the samething with a living creature.Unfortunately there's a gapbetween the molecular structure of metaland that of living tissue,which I must bridge.What are these burns?That's some we stilldon't quite understand.Paul, look at the watch.Would it be possiblefor the direction of themagnetic field, the polarity,to change in projection?I suppose it could.I've never really thought about it.We better start thinking about it.If this kind of distortion is present,no wonder the guinea pig died.(fizzling)Hot?No, a shock.Maybe there is something in my theory.Look what the shock has done.(ominous music)No human being could survivea time transition of that kind.Not without fearful consequences.(foreboding music)Who are you?I'm assisting Professor Steiner.Who are you?Dr. Blanchard,director of this foundation.Well then you should knowbetter than to startle mewhen I'm focusing a microscope.Let me see your identification card.Certainly.This is a classifieddivision, the work is secret.No one is allowed inwithout my permission.She has permission.Mine.Dr. Hill is workinghere at my own expense.Even so, an arrangement of that sortrequires my authority.What name did you say?Dr. Hill.Dr. Patricia Hill.(chuckling)I'm extremely sorry, Dr. Hill.I apologize. For a moment,I didn't recognize you.Maybe it's my overall or the lighting.I'm sure you will be of great assistanceto Professor Steiner.She already has been.With her help, I'm on theverge of demonstratingproof of my theory.(chuckling)I am glad to hear it.Oh,by the way, Steiner,I hope Dr. Mitchel made itquite clear this morningthat I can not agree againto these demonstrationsbeing taken at short notice.Quite clear.You see, I have to warn other projectsthat may be needing power.These matters have tobe properly programmed.I said Dr. Mitchel made your point.Good.Well, I won't interrupt you any further.Goodnight, Professor Steiner.Dr. Hill.Please don't think thefoundation finds you unwelcome.Thank you, Dr. Blanchard.Paul, look at this.Why didn't you tell meabout Professor Steiner'sarrangement with Dr. Hill?He said he'd tell you himself.What Professor Steinerwanted to tell me himselfis immaterial.You represent me on this project.I hope you haven't forgottenwhere your loyalties lie.My loyalties belong to the foundation.Very proper.Miss Anderson,I have agreedthat Dr. Hill be workinghere for a short time.But I must emphasize that in future,no visitor to thisdepartment must be admittedwithout my personal authority.Is that clear?Yes, sir.Ha.What are you doing?Dictating reports.Well leave it.Come with me.Mitchel,I want you to regard what I'm about to sayas highly confidential.Yes, sir.I've been instructed that next Tuesdaythe ministry is sending Professor Lembachof the Geneva Institute downto witness a demonstrationof Professor Steiner'sprojection experiment.Professor Lembach, yes.Obviously it will benecessary for you to knowyou will have preparations to makebut I would be obligedif you didn't mention thevisit to Professor Steiner.That is, for the time being.But Dr. Blanchard...Mitchel, please, please.There are reasons why thevisit should not be announced.I will, myself, informProfessor Steiner in ample time.In that case, why tell me?As I said, Mitchel,you are my representative,not Steiner's.That should be sufficient.I still don't understand.(chuckling)It's not going to beas simple as we thought.I had hoped that Lembach'svisit would throw him,but he seems to be moreadvanced than I'd imagined.He's brought in a pathologist.You're in no position toallow anything to go wrong now.[Blanchard] But what canI do? My hands are tied.You'll have to use yourposition with the ministryto delay the demonstrationuntil I found out how far he's got.Put it off?After I've spent three exhausting daysheckling the minister to arrange it?But you have to acceptthat things have changed in three days.He may have achieved somesort of breakthrough.I must find out before anyofficial demonstration...I'm quite uninterested.Really, I am.That demonstration willtake place but it will fail.Steiner must be discreditedin front of an official party.[Blanchard] But Latham,how can I possiblymake sure that it will fail?If not, there are certain aspects ofyour warm and cozy private lifethat suddenly will becomemuch more widely known.All right! All right![Latham] Good!We're agreed then.(ominous music)(machinery humming)(buzzing)(electrical pulsing)(ringing)(triumphant music)(heart monitor beating)I'll have to do amore careful examinationbut I think I can pronouncethe patient fit and well.(laughing)Paul, that's splendid.Congratulations.Hey, do I get a kiss too?It needed such a tiny adjustmentto counteract that time phase.There's nothing to preventme from calling the ministryand arranging a demonstration.Chris, get the glasses.I think we deserve a celebration.This is really goingto embarrass Blanchard.Don't be too hard on him.After all, it's his joband we're not one of his pet projects.You are too generous.Blanchard hasn't spoken to you.About what?Well if it's something thatconcerns us all, tell us.It's supposed to be confidential.He's arranged a demonstration.- He's done what?- [Patricia] When?For Tuesday.The ministry are bringProfessor Lembach down.He told me days ago andordered me not to tell you.What does he expect to gain?I can't believe it,unless he's so childish hethinks he can embarrass me.Chris, don't tell him you told me.Don't even tell him we've succeeded.I can be childish too and surprise him.I'm tremendously excitedover this demonstration.May I take your glass,Professor Lembach?Danke schon, danke schon.(chuckling)In some ways, I think it's a pityyour visit couldn't havebe delayed, professor.I'm sure Steiner wouldprefer to demonstrateat a later date.There are urgencies.My ministry is anxious to take advantageof this offer of collaborationfrom Professor Lembach's.It's no so urgent, Mr. Latham,but my dear friend andcolleague assures memy visit will not be wasted.Danke schon.Sheila?We also drink who only stand and wait.Then don't stand or wait.That's quite aperformance of Blanchard's.If only he knew what was in store for him.I plea that you're not part of all that.Paul's very grateful to you.So am I.You knew him very well, didn't you?I worked with him once in Stockholmsoon after I qualified.That's all.You're sure I wouldn't betreading on anyone's toesif I asked you to have dinner with me?No.I know what you mean,but that was all finished a long time ago.I'd be delighted.It's a remarkable development, Paul,but I don't understand howyou've overcome the time element.Oh well, you will very soon.Shall we start?Mitchel,would you check that everything's ready?Yes, professor.(pleasant music)Where would you like to go?Chris, I'd rather Paul didn't know.But I thought you said...I did and I meant it.Oh I don't know, he's on edge.I wouldn't want to do anythingthat would precipitate...You see, he trusts us.What's that got to do withme taking you out to dinner?Nothing, really.It's just him and hiswork I'm thinking about.In here, Professor Lembach.(machinery humming)Ready?Ready.(machinery buzzing)Dr. Hill will show you the subjectfrom the first part of our demonstration,which is the transformation of the subjectinto stored energy.Please watch the subject carefullywhen I give the signal to transmit.(machinery buzzing)Secondary relays in.[Chris] Secondary relays in.(machinery buzzing)Transmit.(machinery buzzing)The animal is now inthe form of pure energywhich is stored in that cell over there.I will now project theanimal onto the target table.We have corrected the time lag elementwhich caused death inour early experiments.Please watch the target table.(machinery pulsing)Laser preheat.[Chris] Laser preheat.In.Laser emission relay.[Chris] Laser emission relay...On.(machinery ringing)Relay one.Relay two.(machinery ringing)Project.(electrical popping)(fizzling)Cut the power!(sizzling)(steam hissing)The power line of the storage cellis completely burned out.Just like depriving the brain of blood.It's completely destroyed.So we can't project the rat?He's gone wherever good rats go.God, what was Mitchel ever thinking of?Why? What's it got to do with him?Maintenance is part of his function.Perhaps he's just loyal to Blanchard.Paul, that's unfair and you know it.I don't know anything anymore.What about Blanchard?Have you seen him?Oh, he ran off withLembach and that man, Latham,like a scolded cat.You must explain.We must try and arrange another...Paul!What do you want?I've been checking.Well, it's a bit late for excuses.Paul, please.- I'm not making any.- [Chris] Look at this.A burn through. That'shardly surprising.Look at the leads.They're burned through,what should I expect?I specifically told youto check everything.I did! You still can't see what's wrong?Those are acid burns.Sabotage.When the power built up,the natural heat in thewires completed the rupture.I'm surprised we weren't all killed.Who would want to do such a thing?Somebody who wanted tomake sure the experimentwas never completed.Well, it doesn't make any difference.Will be months beforewe can be ready again.I can replace this overnight.You can't replace the storage cell.Without it, the apparatus is useless.I think it's only shorted.Well, if you're right,then we can recharge it.I'm darn sure we can.How long is Lembach staying?I'll find out.Pat.I'm afraid this takesprecedence over dinner.Chris, what does I mean?The idea thatsomebody would want todestroy Paul's discovery,it frightens me.But if that was their intention,they certainly haven't succeeded.If we work day and night,get the apparatus in order,achieve another perfect projection,we can convince everyone,including Blanchard.Can I help?Well, I could always do with a mate.Lembach is staying inLondon another few days.Arrangements are being madefor me to have dinner with himat Blanchard's house.Well then you'll beable to convince him.Yes but someone seems tobe trying to prevent me.Paul, that's the voice of despair.I'm sure we can get it in order again.Do you think so?Yes, I do.If I stand here talking,I'll never even get started.Pat.I wish I could be fully sure I trust him.Why shouldn't you?You're the only one Ihave faith in now, Pat.Don't desert me.What do you mean?He's paid by the foundation, not by me.Pat, I've been watching both of you.Be very careful before you go too far.Paul, you're tired.I think you ought to go home and rest.I'll call you as soon as he's ready.No.I have to be sure that I'm ready.Why?What do you have in mind?An idea.Nothing more.(somber music)(banging)But I have succeeded!My dear Paul,this is neither the timenor the place to argue.Now we sit comfortably,digesting Dr. Blanchard'sexcellent dinner.I am not arguing.I am stating facts.I have only to call my twoassistants who are waiting.I can arrange ademonstration tonight, now!Steiner.You are behaving inexcusably.You were only invitedbecause Professor Lembachwanted to meet you againbefore returning to Geneva.This is unfair.My demonstration was ruined.Demonstrations do go wrong, Paul.I do not hold it against you.But I can not remain in London.I'm needed in Geneva.My demonstration was sabotaged.Nonsense.It's true.I have evidence.This is my evidence.It doesn't take a technicalmind to see the acid burnson the ends of the connections.If there had been sabotage,Dr. Mitchel would've told me.At my request, he did not.Come with me and see for yourself!Steiner!I had no intention of telling you tonight,but now you are forcing me.Only this morning, my committee decidedthey've gone far enough.Your experiment will be abandoned.Tomorrow you will startdismantling your laboratoryto make room for anotherand more urgent project.I can not accept your decision.It's monstrous.I've achieved success.You can not deny me my demonstration!You have no choice.How long will you gentlemen be here?Some time, why?Then I will give youevidence that will force youto reclaim my discovery.I can not allow my friend toleave in this state of mind.Professor?I think it would bebetter to leave him alone.Were you not hard on him, doctor?It was not of my seeking.In any case, he had to be told.Under the circumstances,this seemed as good a time as any.What were his prospects of success?Well,like most other advanced experiments,limited.When are you letting me have your viewsto put to my government?Within a few days, professor.Well, in that case,I shall be very glad ifyou will ask your committeeto delay their final decisionuntil I can see the process for myself.We must none of us forgetjust how brilliant aman, Professor Steiner, is.(phone ringing)Hello?Oh, Dr. Hill.No, he isn't back yet.Not back?Have you heard from him?No.It's getting very late.I can't stay much longeror I'll miss my bus.Who is it?It's Dr. Hill.Sheila, I need your help.Of course, professor.All right, come with me.(phone ringing)Leave it.But it'll be Dr. Hill again.I said leave it.(phone ringing)I want to know why Sheilaput the telephone down.If he did...But he said he would callas soon as he was ready.I think something's wrong.I want to go back to the laboratoryand find out what's happened.All right, all right.I want to know what's happened too.(car engine starting)(machinery humming)I'm sure I'll neverget it right, professor.Now don't be frightened, Sheila.When I raise my hand,press this.When all these lights are on,press this.Yes.Press this, watch the lights.The sound will then die downand rebuild.I've programmed the entire second stage.All you have to rememberis when all these lights are burning,press this.I understand, professor.Now don't be frightened.When this is all over,you can tell your boyfriendsthat you helped trigger an experimentthat made scientific history.(machinery humming)(machinery buzzing)(machinery fizzling)Shelia!Don't touch anything!(ominous music)(machinery fizzling)(Paul gasping)He's trying to project himself.Sheila's disrupted the program.(fizzling)(Paul gasping)What do we do?Nothing.I can't stop the program.He wouldn't talk to us.He knew we'd try and stop him.(Paul screaming)(suspenseful music)(electrical pulsing)He doesn't intend bringing himself backto the target table.(machinery ringing)Stop her Chris!(machinery fizzling)(ominous music)(clanking)Don't push it too hard.We got plenty of time.Shut up, Gloria.Three more minutes and we're done.I'll go and take a look,see if you've open up the neighborhood.You get at it.I meant get at that.There will be time for the other, later.(cat meowing)What's that?How the hell should I know?A cat, I expect.Never heard a cat make a noise like that.Perhaps he was having a bit of funand she wasn't in the mood.(chuckling)(clanking)(cat screaming)(electrical fizzling)There you are, Gloria,what did I tell you?A flipping cat.Relax girl, relax.All right.Oh God, I could do with a drink.You'll be gettingsomething more than a drinkwhen we get through this lot.(laughing)Steve, hurry!There's someone over there by that mound.I can see him moving.Well go and take a look.If it's a bloke, chat him up.But keep him away from here.(tools clanking)Hello there.Have you got the time?(man groaning)(screaming)(electrical fizzling)What the bloody hell didshe scream like that for?How should I know?I'm gonna go and take a look.Gloria?Gloria?Gloria?Come on, girl, wake up.Don't muck about.No.(footsteps crunching)(screaming)(electrical fizzling)Gloria?Harry?Where the hell are you?(ominous music)(footsteps crunching)(gasping)(electrical fizzling)(menacing music)(suspenseful

table.(foreboding music)Electrocution?We found them slap in themiddle of a building site.There was no power cablewithin a hundred yards.Come and look.The burns are typical.(phone ringing)That'll be for me.Inspector Davis.Ah, Martin, you got it?One's Harry Slinger,The woman's Gloria King,which must make the over Steve Lowe.That's got to make quitea whole in the road scary.I'm sorry about old Harry, though,he was so bloody bad at it.What were they up to, exactly?Of all things,digging away into the furriers.So crude, they nearly got away with it.Want their pictures?Wait a minute.Will I be able to recognize them?No, don't bother.Just round up a few relativesfor formal identification.The cause of death, I'mtold, was electrocution.You better get down thereand see if you can findout any reason why.Electrocution?Yes, I know.See you later.Well, let's have a look.You chaps amaze me.I barely finish an examinationand here you are putting names to them.We amaze ourselves sometimes.Yeah,that's Lowe all right.Well, well, well.I've seen Harry in a good many positions,but I never expectedto see him in this one.You silly old fool.And the woman's here, on the table.I say she was scared too.All three had a similar look.Something else that might interest you.Another body.Another?It, too, died of electrocution.I thought that damnedLembach would never go.What's on Steiner's mind?Something prettyspectacular, if I know him.Has he repaired the damage?I don't know.He and Mitchel have beenworking day and night.You ought to get yourhands on those tapes of his.You're still sure they arethe key to his experiments?Yes, they are.Yes.We should get them tonight,before he removes them himself.Yeah,we can get them now.We?You then.I hardly think it's my line of country.I can't do it by myself.I've got to take care of the security man.Now, this is what we'll do.I will drive into the foundationwith you concealed in the boot of my car.I'll give you my keys,you find your way upinto the main laboratory,help yourself to the tapes.In the meantime,I'll take the security man up to my officeand that way, nosuspicion will fall on me.Or on you either, of course.Well?Come on.(car horn honking)I want you.We've been trying to getyou on the telephone, sir.Me? What for?Yes, it's Dr. Mitchel, sir.He's waiting up in your officewith Dr. Hill and Miss Anderson.There's been some trouble inProfessor Steiner's laboratory.Is Professor Steiner still here?Well, he did come in here earlier, sir.Anybody in the laboratory?No sir.Did you want me for anything, sir?Doesn't matter now.(knocking)(suspenseful music)Well,it seems just as well thatI decided to return tonight.Even so, I find yourexplanation pure fantasy.To me it makes sense.He was obviously tryingto project himself.The cross on the map isexactly on your house.With these calibrationshe worked out distance andtrajectory from the foundation.The graph bears me out.And you are seriously suggestingthat he would materializehimself in my study?Well, perhaps not in your study,but in your house, certainly.Dr. Hill, I can understandhow upset you are,but what you suggest is illogical.There is nothing illogicalin what I am saying.Then tell me, where is he now?We can't.Sheila unwittingly disturbed the program.He could be anywherein any state.(Sheila whimpering)Do we have to kep Sheila here?She looks exhausted.(crying)It's my eyes.They're hurting.I'm sorry, Sheila.Maybe you should see a doctor.All right, I'll see to it.It's past 2 o'clock in the morning.How will you get home?I can't.Look, look, look.You just run to your officeand get those clothes off.I'll see that you're driven home.(whimpering)(ominous music)(suspenseful music)It was an unfortunate accident.None of you can blame yourselves.What exactly happened atyour house earlier tonight?Circumstances forced me to tell himthe project had been canceled.You can't mean it.Not now.It's already been done.As for you, Mitchel,you're suspended from your dutiespending an investigation into your conductduring the course of the project.(ominous music)(menacing music)(yelling)(ominous music)(suspenseful music)(electrical fizzling)(gasping)(electrical fizzling)(clicking)Well,no point of staying here in the dark.The cancellation is final.Nothing more to be said about it.But I must impress upon you boththat the work of thisfoundation is classified.There's no need to remind us.We both signed the official secret oath.All I need do is toemphasize the necessityof keeping your mouths shut.(suspenseful music)(whimpering)[Paul] Sheila!(menacing music)There seems no reasonwhy Dr. Mitchel and Ican not complete the experimentjust to show what success we've achievedif for Dr. Steiner's sake.A nice sentiment, Dr. Hill.You assume I noticed thatProfessor Steiner, himself,would not be able to continue.But I didn't mean...Don't fool yourself, Blanchard.He has succeeded and oncemore he will be back here,in his office, at any time.Then, if he retains his faculties,he will know that it willnot be to much purpose.Sometimes you're so cruelthat I think you musthave some other motive.Miss Anderson is...She will think I have forgotten her.[Patricia] Oh, that mangives me the shutters.Well, he certainly has a whip pan now.(ominous music)(menacing music)(suspenseful music)God, I'm tired.What would you like, a drink?Yes, please.Is it such a little whileago since we've been here?About four hours.Don't look so worried.We don't know what's happened.It's not the end of the world anyway.For Paul it could be.You really are fond of him, aren't you?Of course.But it's you I love.(dramatic music)(whimpering)Please, let me go.Not until you've answered my questions.What do you know about this man, Latham?But I'm only a secretary.You helped me once.Help me again.It's my eyes.They're hurting.Dr. Mitchel thought Iought to see a doctor,Professor Stei...It's all right, Sheila,you can use the name.I know who I am.Tell me about Latham, thenwe'll see about a doctor.Well, he spent a lot oftime with Dr. Blanchard,but no one ever knew what he was exactly.What do you think he was doing, Sheila?Spying on us?Please, Professor, I don't know.Truly, I don't.When I wasn't there,did either of them gointo the lab without me?Oh yes.Wasn't it all right?No, it wasn't.How often?Several times.Mostly Mr. Latham by himself.Why didn't you tell me?Wasn't for me toquestion him, professor.I thought you'd know.Please, can I go and bath my eyes now?Did they ask you to keep it as a secret?Don't worry, I'm not going to harm you.Did they?Well, not exactly.Not exactly?Either you know or you don't, which is it?Well, Dr. Blanchard did tell me oncethat I was working for the foundation,not you.I see.All right, Sheila, go an bath your eyes.Then I can go?We'll see.How long ago did you leave me?Just as long as it takes to make coffee.You move to quietly.Come back to bed.Don't you realize that it's a new day?There's been no word?No.Here, drink your coffee.I'll telephone.(phone ringing)Yes?Oh, Dr. Blanchard.Yes.Yes, as quickly as we can.Something dreadful hashappened at the lab.Is it him?Blanchard didn't say, but he soundedfrightened.How much longer will they be?Any moment, I should think.Dr. Hill, Dr. Mitchel.It's not...I am sorry to bring you back.Who were you expecting it to be?We were half expectingit to be Professor Steiner.I see.Now answer my questions quickly.I want my squad here fastand until this official secretthing's cleared up, I can't.What was on those computers?Programmed tapes of our experiments.Where are they?That's roughly what I'm asking you.Now don't touch anything.I wasn't going to.There's no need to look any further.These were the tapes.Dr. Blanchard tells meyou are a pathologist.Until my surgeon gets here,is there anything you cantell me about how he died?At first sight, Iwould say electrocution.Can you see anything thatwould account for that?No.I think I can.There's too much forit to be a coincidence.I've seen the very same thing earlier on.Well, there's no possible doubtwhy the lights when out last night.Somebody's fused the main power line.You mean, him?No, he's still be hanging there,charred to a cinder.What about those tapes?As far as I can tell, they're all there.The result of severalyears of work in ruins.You mean all your programs?Every single one.[Blanchard] Don't youhave records, notes?Not one.For security reasons,the tapes weren't transcribed.We were going to do it whenthe experiments were completed.But you could replace them.No.Not without Steiner.[Inspector] Can I get on?Yes, inspector.If the tapes are destroyed,then there is nothingleft of a secret nature.What was Latham doing here?That is for the inspector to determine.Thank you.What time did the lights go out?[Chris] Oh it was about 2:15, wasn't it?Just about.Inspector, I will be inmy office when you want me.[Inspector] Don't leave the buildingwithout letting me know.I had no such intention.This experiment Dr.Blanchard was talking about,the one that brought youback here last night,tell me about it.[Patricia] Well weleft Professor Steinercompleting some important work.We got anxious abouthim and he telephoned.(phone ringing)(ominous music)(phone ringing)Yes?[Cigar Man] Is Latham with you?Who's that?[Cigar Man] Where is Latham, Blanchard?I ask, who's that speaking?I'm an associate.In fact, you might saythat we are very close.You understand?Latham's dead.[Cigar Man] Then who has the tapes?The tapes have been destroyed.[Cigar Man] Destroyed?How did that happen?I don't know what went wrong.[Cigar Man] Then you willkindly rearrange our affairsso that they do succeed.No, it's finished.[Cigar Man] On no, Dr. Blanchard,it is not finished.I don't pay such largesums of money for failure!Never forget, I still havethose photographs in my safe.I can do no more.[Cigar Man] Now will youlisten to me, Blanchard?I wish I'd never...[Cigar Man] Listen to me, Blanchard!You sold yourself to me a long time ago!It's too late now to tell methat you wish to change your mind!Now presuming ProfessorSteiner is still alive,in what state do you expect him to be?We've no idea what effectthe interruption ofthe program would have.Where's this place you found the body?Corner of Evanston Street.You realize that'snot above a quarter of a milefrom where Blanchard lives.It couldn't be.Why not?From what you've toldme of his experiments,do you really believe that it'sbeyond the realms of possibility?I know of nothing in theconcept of the human bodythat could cause an imprint like that.I've seen several like it.Where did he go?But if he has beenin some way transmuted,we don't know what intelligencehe would have retained.Presuming that he did do this,them he must've been capableof finding his way back here.So why don't we try his apartment?But I can't stop here.Someone will be starting to look for me.My mom, most likely.Didn't you tell her youwould be working late?Oh, she's used to mebeing out all hours.Anyway, Dr.
