Give us “The Boy I Love”!This theatre,the Old Bedford in Camden Townused to be the favouritetheatre of Marie Lloyd,the famous music hall singer.Now, it’s just a mess.For the last few years,it served as a shelterfor pigeons, and tramps,and vagrants.It’s not a very good shelter,either,because there’s a bloodygreat hole in the roofand the rain comes pelting in.Old plaster decorationthat used to be up there,pretty masks and the nymphsand shepherdsand the fancy scroll work isjust a lot of rubble on the floor.When a theatre has servedits purposeand there are no longer anypeople with inclinationto come to it, by all means,send for the wreckers,have it knocked down.But the sad thing about this placewas that it was dead on itsfeet for so long,putrefying.Particularly sad becauseonce upon a time,it must have contained such a welterof laughter, and life, and joy.Because on this stage thereappeared most of the greatmusic hall artists of the time.And most of the not sogreat music hall artists.Among whom you may findthe name of Belle Elmore,whose ghost may very wellstill be flapping around backstagebecause she was thewife and eventual victimof Dr Crippen.Who, somewhere in Camden Townnot too far from this theatre,done the poor lady in.There’s another reasonfor feeling very tender aboutthis theatre and that is,that it was one of the favouritehaunts of Walter Sickert.He used to come herenight after nightwith a sketching pad on his kneeand sketch away,while Bessie Bellwood andMarie Lloydwould set the cockneys singing.All together now.Camden Town is named afterthe Earl of Camdenwhose family owned the estate in the18th and 19th centuries.The area, although it’s changing,is still recognisableas the world of Sickert.Here, seedy terraces arecoming up in the worldafter years of neglect.Like Rome, London has its catacombs.These, beneath theCamden Freight Terminal,were once used for themovement of dray horsesacross the yards.The yard is more or less as it waswhen the railway people usedthe horsesto carry packages andparcels across London.There were about 300 horsesand a blacksmith and asaddler had workshops here.Within easy reach of thestables at the railway sheds.Trains passed quite close by,just as they still do today.This is the Roundhouse.A giant turntable for railwayengineswhich was built at a time whenengine drivers still wore top hats.Actually, it was partially designedby George Stephenson himself,the Father of the Railwayand the inventor of thefamous engine, the Rocket.Having once given steamengine its initial shove,he was obliged to applyhis creative geniusto inventing all the other gadgetsthat went with railway traffic.All these bits and pieces meantsomething, once upon a time.They are what you mightcall the crumbling images of a pastbut we’d be foolishto mourn them too readily.That was the romantic age ofrailways.The Age of Steam.And, to my way of thinking,they finally put an end to thatwith the ritual tearingdown of Euston stationa couple of years back.But you can still pick upsome of the old atmospherein some of the London termini.For instance, Broad Streethas a working model of aVictorian railway engine,which can be activatedby a penny in the slot.The street markets still havea certain Victorian boisterousness.They are London’s freeentertainers.One of the best of them is here inChurch Street, Edgware Road.A nice, quiet street you might say,but you should see it on Saturdaymorning.Here, give me a plum packet.Have a feel.Here you are, have a feel.Don’t forget to give ’em back.That’s how we got hold of ’em.Now, I said just now thatI wouldn’t do it againbut I apologise if you paid more.I’ve’ve got to clear stockand let’s be quite truthful, people.We haven’t come down herefor the bloody benefit ofour health.What can you lose, ladies?It’s a fantastic bargain,it really is.Look, Sheffield-made chutney,one price and one price only.Yours or I’ll clear ’em out the way.Jack and Jill went up thehill to fetch a pale of water,poor old Jill forgot her pilland come down with a daughter.All registered on the day.Over there two and three.Rhubarb, governor!You’ll give me twopound for it, won’t you?No? I’ll make you say yes,I will, I’ll make you say yes.I’m going to charge you 30 shillings,is that all right?It’s got four compartments,four compartments.One of the compartments has got azip.Always nicks the last of the butter.Now, come and see, to wash itthrough,wash it in Momo, Oxo, Bisto, Polo,any ‘O’ you like.If you’d like it offof me, there they are.Come and see.If you can make use ofthem they can cover upall your rude bits whenyou get out of the bath.But if you’d like themoff of me, there they are.There’s a pair in blue fordirty buggers.there’s a pair, they’re in ice blue.Got a pair here in pink.What colour would you choose fora pair?Billy Gramme, help me out,put money in their pursesand take the moth balls out.Hallelujah.15 bob a time.You’ll pay 35 bob inthe shop, a pound in …This is Romano House.On the side of Romano’s Restaurant,which in its time must havebeen one of most swinging.There used to be a tankof goldfish in the windowand the story is that one ofthe Bohemiansonce relieved himself in the tank,which must have pleased theinhabitants.Which reminds me of another story,of the gold fish a former attendantkept in one of these tanksin the Holborn gents.A fish that went down in the worldwhen the water level dropped.These fish don’t live here,of course,we just popped them inby way of illustration.This public conveniencedates back to 1897.It’s one of the few in which theoriginal fittings are preserved.It’s an outstanding survivalof Victorian London,it’s quite clear that aVictorian loois quite a work of art.Here, one might say,one finds the only true democracybecause all men are equalin the eyes of a lavatory attendant.This lavatory in Star Yardis also typically Victorian.As are the fine gas lampsin many parts of London.There’s one inCarting Lane, which is quite unique.This is Carting Lane,it’s in The Savoy,a name which is synonymous withGilbert and Sullivan operasand the D’Oyly Carte Companywhich performed them.Here’s the lamp.What makes this sospecial is that it says,“Sewer Ventilating Lamp.”The heat of the lamp at thetop draws up the vapoursthrough this … hollow stem.We don’t want to lose this,it’s not only beautiful but unique.As unique, almost,as this gentleman,who is among the last of theold-fashioned lamplighters.Men go and come, but Earth abides.And with it, the river,without which, of course, no greatcity like Londoncan hope to survive.Just a little way down river of herewhere London Bridge now stands,in approximately 43 A.D,the Romans managed toflood the River Thamesand established what accordingto all available evidencewas a trading centre.Until a few years ago,there was a very real dangerthat London Bridge might fall down,something to do with theriver bed being a bit soft,but they’ve managed toprop it up successfully,I hope.There’s a handy egg Breaking Plantfor anyone who might be interested.Somewhere down in that directionthe old Clink Prison stood.However, this prison is nolonger referred to as ‘Clink’and it’s only the oldestand most inveterate lagwho’d use the expression.“He’s just out of Clink,”you might hear somebody saying.A bit further down the riverfrom here,pirates at low tide werechained hand and footand left to drown.Some people found it fun tosit and drink and watch them.Not a very agreeable sight.Not too happy about this, either.At one time there must havebeen an almost perfect viewof St Paul’s from here,but you could hardly say so now.The partial destructionof the city of Londonin the Second World War,offered us a great opportunityto reconstruct in a waythat was not only practical,but also aesthetic,but somehow we blew it.But even that doesn’taccount for that monstrosityon the left with the green roof.Ick.At any rate,while Sir Christopher Wrenwas building St. Paul’s,he chose to live in this house here,which offered an unrestricted viewof the work in progress.Although it has an 18th centuryfacade,if you go inside you will seethat there are parts of itwhich date back to the 1500s.If Christopher Wren was stillthe occupant of this house,his address would beCardinal’s Wharf.And his garden, such as it is,would back on to Cardinal Cap Alley,Southeast one.This man is a street entertainer,a busker.There’s not more than about adozen of them left in London.They tend to live in furnishedrooms near their pitch.And on a good night, thisman can earn something like, um …three poundsplaying to a cinema andtheatre queues.He spent a great deal of his moneyby adding to his collectionof fancy costumes.This chap’s also got an assistant,and they split the takings.It’s not the easiest way to earna living.Thank you. Jolly good luck,all the best.All the money I get isfor those poor girlsthat fell in Hyde Parkwhile the blackout was on.Well, I used to, uh, years ago,1935, between 1935 to 1937,I used to be in the music hallswhere I had a treble act.Uh, my partners have sincebeen killedand I came down to Londonjust after they were killed.Uh, got a job as an insurance clerk,went up to the west end one dayand seen some buskersand that’s how I started busking.Um, well, I’m a geniusand I felt I was psychologicallyunfit for normal work.And that’s how I started busking.I’ll allow you the opportunityto stop, watch, look, and listen.Now, you’ll be asking,whose done this before.But I’m going to show you that here,I’ve got the direction.With your assistance I shallsee myself.Right now, I’ve never seen itdone correct.Have I got any person in thisaudience?Any man.You’ll have a go?Pick up the chain.There’s a lock there.Chain around the biceps.You know where the biceps are?Take it at the back.Chain it.Tight.Pull it.Are you married?I am.What a pity for your wife.Where do you wanna go now?That’s the idea!Pull it.Come on, let’s see something.You’re like an old woman.It’s hard work.Two and six or a half acrown, ladies or gents.This is Chapel Market, Islington.Morning.Hi.Sorry to have bumped you, sir.That’s all right.When the eating is over anddone with,there’s always theundertaker at your service.At least we have a dignifiedsend-off.We get silk and satin,not the spoon and fork.We’re embalmed in cherished memoriesnot jelly and vinegar.I lost my money on the stockexchange in 1929 in England.And then stayed out in San Franciscoto 1940 where I decidedto come back to England.I always stayed in theSalvation Armybecause the rent was veryreasonable.Only 63 shillings aweek for a private room,which they have 60 of themand we got a free breakfastfor the 63 shillings.I don’t think you could beat thatif you stayed in the Savoy Hotel.May I join you?Yes.Yes.I was just looking at the pricesthere.Oh yeah.They’re quite stiff, seems to me.Yes. Yes, they are.How much do I have to payfor a bed a night to stay?Six shillings here.Do you get any breakfast?Oh, yes, definitely, yes.What do you get?Well, porridge.Porridge.Egg. Whatever you want.You can either have a porridge,tea and two slices.Or you could have an egg,or tea and two slices.Yeah.Six bob?Yes.Yes.How often do you stay here?Do you stay here all the time?Yes, all the time.I’ve been here couple of years …When did you first come here?What made you first of all, um,decide to come to a Salvation Armyhostel?Yes, uh,I lost my wife about sevenyears ago with cancerand, uh, it was, I couldn’t, uh,I had to get out couldn’t have thatroomand, uh, that’s how I know,it’s the best place I could getanywhere,the only place I could find.I’d been ‘round to otherplaces, but no use though.I find this place all right, myself.Do you find that living in hereis a disadvantage to getting work?I do, very much.You do?Why?Well, because, uh …A lot of people don’tlike the address, sir.If you got to employers of labour.Yeah?And you mention this address,I’m afraid you’re bound.But most of them, most that livehere, like yourselfare people who, um, are down onyour luck.Exactly right, exactly.Of course the Salvation Army shelteris only for those who can afford it,the elite you might say.Those who can’t afford itare the ones who sleep rough on abomb site.The brotherhood of the leaky boot,and the defeated look in the eye,the ones who can’t and won’tcommunicate with their fellow man.The Salvation Army is clearly moredurable than the Yiddish Theatre,because here’s our Yiddish Theatreand what is that surrendered to?Bingo.And bingo, in turn, was surrenderedto the wrecker becausethe enormous modern blocksare on the march and alreadythreateningeach last little shop on the corner.And here’s one that looks asif it might be an exception.The Marks family have hada thriving business herefor something like a hundred years.And I wouldn’t mindbetting it’ll be aroundfor another hundred.Who wants serving?Who wants serving?- Yes, please.- No.Thank you very much.Let me have a jar of gefilte fish,please.Spitalfields in the east endwas a long time ago anarea for the prosperous.Now, it’s mainly for the poor.Hello. Can I come in for a fewminutes?Okay.Thank you.Spitalfields is Jack The Ripperterritory.The old people here even remembersome of his murders.In this yard, just over there,Jack disposed of victim number twoand the poor of the parish clubbedtogetherto buy a nice wreathfor her funeral.These streets are exactlythe same as they were at that time.Fournier Street.Built by the Huguenots in 1724.These doorways are the originalsand have been altered only slightly.They’re among the finestof their kind in London.This shop front in Artillery Lanewas built for a silk mercerby a carpenter, Abraham Swan,in the 17th Century.You cheated, you cheated,you big fat liar!For much too long, thesechildren have only hadtheir own doorsteps to play on,but happily, all this seems tobe changing.And for the first time, these kidsare being given a decent break.For some, however,it’s happened too late.I have been trying hereand there, to see …to see whether I could, uh …better myself in a better way,you see.I have been trying.Mostly trying. It’s difficult.But, I’ve been trying veryhard and different ways,to see if I can …to see if I can becomesomething of myself …in time.The same thing will soon behappeningto most of the buildingswe’ve been looking at.They’re out of date, inefficient,taking up too much space.But there’s no need to be too sadabout itbecause, after all,most of Victorian Londonwas fairly hideous.And we can also console ourselveswith the knowledge thatthe same fate attendsour least favourite modernmonstrosities.Man is fighting man,brother is fighting brother,nation is fighting nation,the world is in a turmoil.Satan is not king.The book has told youthat what God will dowhen he comes on this earth,he will banish Satan foreverand you will see who is the rulerof this universe.I have told you once again, becareful,be warned, the time is now.
