Especiallywhen talking about...Jizz?I have to find a wayto make you stop talking.Do you think it wasPatrick and Melanie?I made you some incase you got hungry.- Why was Patrick here?- Huh?Patrick. Why was he here?Well, it's kind of hardnot to invite him. We havea lot of the same friends.So you invited him?Just a part of the generalinvite to the usual suspects.I didn't think he'dactually show up.I just thought it was goingto be the most tactful wayto handle the situation.Did you invite Melanie too?Oh, my God. Fucking Melanie. Whoeven pronounces it like that?No, of course not.Here. Eat somebefore it gets cold.We should get some light in.See how bad the damage is.Fucking hell.You assholes scaredthe shit out of me.Who are they?I don't know, butthey can fuck off.Hello.Good morning, Jo.Did you sleep well?Who is this?I am the Big Gay Bunny.I appear to all the littlelesbian girls after they hadtheir first taste ofthe sapphic fruit.Fuck off.Not your first taste, obviously.We meant Sophie.I want to hear whatthey're saying.Trust me, you don't.Don't pick up.Sophie.Good morning, Sophie. I hopeyour hangover isn't too severe.How would you know about that?I followed yourparty on Instagram.Who are you?As I told Jo already,I'm the Big Gay Bunny.I'm here to welcomeyou to Lesbian Land.Patrick.Friends of his?What do you want?We are here to fuck feminism.Last night, one of ourbrothers cried out for help.You thought you couldjust replace him.But we're here to show youthat men can't be replaced.Now let us in,before I ask the Big Bad Wolfto blow your house down.But that's a bear mask.Sophie call the cops.I'll get the door.Are you calling the police?Where's Benji?We're at nineteenWillamore Drive.There are two men in masksoutside threatening us.No, they haven't broken in.We've locked all the doors andwindows. They're just outside.Send help quickly.They're sendinga police car now.The cops are ontheir way, asshole.How nice.If I were you, I would hopon back to momma's basement.But since I do hope youend up in jail, maybe youshould just stay right there.Actually, I think we'll justwait for the police out front.Are they gone?Look,I know there's a lotof assholes out there,who hate peoplethat are different.It happened to me online. But Ipromise, I'll protect you, okay?Any Internet trolls ever doanything to you in real life?No, but...They've been gettingmore aggressive.Fuck, I wish Ihadn't let Benji out.Why is the bathroom locked?- Can it be lockedfrom the outside? - No.Is someone in there?Who's in the bathroom?Fuck.Who's in there?Is that a bread knife?What the hell areyou doing in there?Sorry, I must've passed out.Hope my male bodydoesn't offend you dykes.What offends us......is this.Well, you two were the onesmaking out in public.It's a bit too lateto demand privacy now.- Where did you post it? - Idon't even fucking rememberwriting that shit, man.Do you know what you've done?We have two freaks inmasks outside rightnow, threatening us.- What? - They're the oneswho sent us this post.- Friends of yours? - Slow down,man. Who the fuck is outside?Two guys in masks.A wolf and a rabbit.- We've called the police.- A rabbit?Fucking...Fuck.What?My phone's gone.And my keys.Those are not our biggestproblems right now.Well, it's prettyclear, you ladies don'tneed me for anything.So I'm just going to go getmy stuff and get out of here.You can't leave withthose guys still out there.It's just two teenagers playinga fucking prank. Calm down.Jesus, this placeis a fucking mess.Can one of youguys call my phone?You don't just get to walk awayfrom the problem you created.I need some aspirin.Medicine cupboard.Top left corner.Nice.Where the fuck are my keys at?Looks like I missed thereal party. This oneyours or your dads'?Would you please take thesituation a bit more seriously?Look, Jo.Nobody wants out of herefaster than me, okay?So here's the deal:I'm gonna go find my keys,and then tell those two kidsto fuck off, as I go to mycar and find some coffee.Then you can stay here and puton your dads' gimp costume,and fantasize abouthaving some real balls.Charming.You know me.Sweet.Would you pleaselook at your phone?Tell us where youposted it and who responded.- Fine.- Thank you.What is it?Well, it's like this forum forguys to complain about women.You know, like their exesor girls rejected them.It's just shit talking.You posted this onan incel hangout?Look, it's just a placefor shit posting. Itdoesn't mean anything.'Oh, I just doxed some girlsto some incels.Man, how was I supposed to knowsomething would happen?'Did anyone respond?Just the usual bullshit, man.Like, if there's a video of youtwo guys doing it,some comments aboutwho is hotter.- You want to hear 'em?- Fuck you.Look, it's just the usualshit, man. Doesn't mean any...Wait, this one's a bit weird:'Time has come for ourdicks to stand up tothe lesbian gynocracy.'- Who wrote that?- The Big Gay Bunny.That's him.Well, he is probably harmless.Yes, and they probablyjust showed up here tobe harmless in person.Look, everybody always talkstough on those forums. Nobodyever does anything in real life.You have no idea, none,what women have togo through every day.Especially those of uswho are gay or trans.Assholes like yourunning around, ruining lives,and then accuse us ofgetting hysterical.- So I'm responsible for thisshit? - Yes. Yes, you are.- Guys?- What?Hear that?Can't make out what's happening.Are those two the guys?Yeah, the policeare talking to themShould we go out?Well, I need my keys.Fuck your keys. Let's wait.I hope the cops arrest them.For what? Wearing masks?I'm gonna go get my keys now.I think we shouldleave with the police.Wait. They have tocome check on us.They're still talking.- I wish one of thecops was female. - Why?Because I'd feel a lot better,if one of them was a woman.Wouldn't you?You've got to let go ofthat pretty straight whitegirl privilege, you know?Look, something's happening.Are they getting handcuffed?I can't make anythingout through this glass.See, they're holdingtheir hands out.No, they're shakinghands. What the fuck?- Are they leaving?- The cops are. Shit.They're just gettingin their car.We need to go. Now.What are you doing?Those guys are still out there.We need to get inthat police car.Stop. Would you?Oh shit. Look, it's going.What just happened?I don't know.Why would they justdrive off like that?Don't answer it.Patrick.- Hello?- Patrick.- Your brothers haveheard your cry, and havecome to help. - Hang up.How did you get this number?You three have gotto stop asking suchpredictable questions.This is worse thana Tinder date.Patrick, hang up.Yeah, well, I don't rememberswiping right on you. Soyou can just fuck off, man.I'm curious. What hurts more?The crick in your neck fromsleeping on the bathroom tiles,or the ass fucking those twodykes gave your masculinity?Who the fuck is this guy, man?Turn around.Benji!Who's a good boy? You are.You know why you're a good boy?Because you let this lesbiancut your balls off.Because you weren'talways such a good boy.I bet you used to bethe big swinging dick ofthis whole neighborhood.Maybe you fucked one too manybitches. Am I right, buddy?But she couldn't standall that testosterone,all that virile power.No. She called ittoxic masculinity.She told everyone itwas a problem. Thatyou needed to be fixed.Fucking hell.So she took your bigmanly balls and went......snip.Breaks my heart to seeyou like this, man.Just a little pet doggy.Sit, boy. Roll over.Now beg forgiveness foryour male privilege.Leave him alone, you sickbastard. I'm calling the cops.Again? They're going to getpretty annoyed with you.You're threateningto kill my dog.So?That is illegal.So is driving a carinto a crowd of protesters.So is marching through the nightwith torches, shouting,'Jews will not replace us.'So is storming the Congressto try and overturn an election.You know what welearn from this?- That you're fucking nuts.- That you're a fascist wannabe?I'm sorry, Jo. I couldn'thear that over the soundof your pathetic crying.I said, I will fucking kill you,if you touch my dog.No, you won't.You liberals are full of shit.You say, 'defund the police','cops are racist pigs'.But then when you're in danger,suddenly it's all,'Where's the police?'You think these honest,hardworking men inblue want you tweetingvideos of the excessiveviolence, they haveto use to defend you?It's their job todefend the people.No. it's their jobto defend order.But that order has collapsed.You killed it.So go ahead and callwhoever you want. Wave yourplacards, create a hashtag.We'll see if anyonecomes to help you.- Oh, shit.- No.Why would you do that?Because it amuses me......to torture a dog.You sick fuck.I'm paraphrasing fromReservoir Dogs, you moron.Yeah, well I'm gonna getmedieval on your ass.That's a differentTarantino film, you idiot.Jo, don't.What do you want?It would be irresponsible ofus to give Patrick his keysback, if he is over the limit.So first, we need him to standon one leg and touch his nose.Super. Now all you have to dois fuck Jo, and we're good.What?You emasculated Patrickby fucking his girl.The only way for him to earnthe return of his balls,is by fucking you back.You're sick.No. You're the one whois unwell, Patrick.You've allowed your mindto be infected with thedisease of liberalism.It makes you want to be agood ally to feminists andgays and people of color.So this lesbian, eatsyour girlfriend's pussy,while you try to rubsome life into a coldhotdog in the bathroom.The first step in being aman, is admitting you'renot okay with that.Our bodies, our choice.What you call a choiceis an insult to nature.Your body evolved to getfucked by men. You'rebiologically wired to love dick.But this virus of liberalfeminism has fuckedup your programing.Have you ever felt thepleasure of a rock hardpenis inside of you, Jo?Don't make me puke.Well, here's the deal.We will all leave peacefully,once Patrick fucks Jo,the way nature intended.Why?Because, when Jo feelsdick inside of herfor the first time,she's going to realizethat feminism has lied to her.And our boy, Patrick.Well, nothing makes you more ofa man than converting a lesbian.Any man who can do that,has truly earned his penis.And what did you do to earnyour miserable prick?We don't want you to end up likethis poor little doggy, Patrick.That's why we're here.To save your balls.So you're not coming out,until you restore your manhood.Don't let thosetwo dykes mock you.Better dead than castrated.Jesus.Be a man.Hey, I know.But there will be timefor this later. Okay?Okay?Sorry about Benji.Fuck you. This is your fault.I didn't fuckingask for this, Jo.We don't have time for this.Jo, call the policeagain. Tell them to cometo the house this time.Patrick, call your footballbuddies. Tell them tobring baseball bats.I'll post across socialmedia. Tell everyone wherewe are and what's going on.Yes. Yes. I'm sure it'sthe same fucking house.Can you please senda female officer?You cannot just send thesame useless fucks asyou did the last time.How am I supposed to stay calmwhen you won't fucking help me?Jo, stop yelling.Sorry. Yes, I willwait for the officers.Just please send help quickly.I know you're upset, but it's nogood shouting at them, okay?It's just always thesame fucking thing.You tell the police thatsome internet trolls arethreatening to rape you,and they just say,'Oh, don't be so sensitive.'But they're coming back, right?Yes. But what if theydon't help us again?Then we shout, 'Fire'.That's what they teach youin rape prevention class.Do you want to call your dads?What's the point?They're on a beach in Malta.I'd just worry them to death.You should see Bastian when hepanics. He's such a drama queen.I can just picture himswinging his arms upand down on the beach.while Greg tries to stophim from hyperventilating.Are you wearing my clothes?If I have to run for my life,I'm not doing it in a cocktaildress and fuck me shoes.Did you come inhere this morning?Just with Patrick, when hewas looking for his phone.This is a serious violationof the Bro Code, dude.Dude, why don't youjust call the cops?We did already.Then what the fuck'sthe problem, man?Because the fucking cops cameand didn't do shit.You really think I wouldbe calling you, if thiswasn't a fucking emergency?Get Jeff and some of theother guys, and bring somefucking baseball bats.- What?- Hang up.I don't know, man. Jeff isreally hung over. I don't evenhave my baseball bat anymore,because I loaned it to Chad, andthe fucker never gave it back.Well, any kind of fuckingstick to hit people with,man. It doesn't matter.These guys have got to run themoment you get out of the truck.- What?- Hang up.Why the fuck arewe even arguing about this, man?Round up the posse and get overhere now. I've got to go. Bye.What? I was literallyin the middle of callingthe fucking cavalry.I think there's another personin the house.What?I think someone was watching mein the bathroom just now.Then I remembered, theoffice door was closed whenI got up, but it was openwhen you found your phone.Must be because Icould hear it ringing.None of us opened it.What the fuck?Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.Who the fuck was that, man?Let's make sure everything'slocked. Jo, check thewindows in your bedroom.- Patrick, check the office.- Yeah.I'll check the bathroom.All locked. We're good.We are not fucking good.They were inside my home.Isn't anyone coming?A lot of people haveseen my posts. They...You have got to be shitting me.Fucking asshole ismocking us, man.The fuck?All right, that's it. I'mcalling fucking everyone.Fire brigade, ambulance,taxis, Pepe's pizza.It's time to shout 'fire'.Fire!How's the hangover?A lot better.You wouldn't believe theemotional support we'regetting on social media.Worth a lot less thanthe Bro Code, I imagine.Nope.They're both worth jack shit.Who else can we call?Well, Emergency Servicessaid they wouldn'trespond to any more prankcalls from this address.And the neighborsare out of town.Yeah.I think our low point waswhen we called Pepe's andinstead of coming to the house,the delivery boy justgave them the pizza.I say we'll make a run for it.Well, we don't have my keys.So we can't start the car.Then we keep swinging,until we hit the streets.We flag someone down andget the fuck out of here.And what if no vehicle ispassing at that exact moment?We should barricade the doors.They can break through thewindows, whenever they want.I'm not going out there.Why did he leave the gimp mask?Maybe somebody else atthe party brought it?Someone wore this andnone of us noticed?What does it matter?Because what if some of theseweird things are connected?Like, why is there a bag of cokein the medicine cupboard?What?Whoa! That is notsupposed to be in there.Maybe it belongs to your dads?Do you know how good Gregis at keeping secrets?My grandparents diedthinking he and Bastianwere just golf buddies.No way, he'd just keep cokein a medicine cupboard.So someone brought it tothe party and left it there,just like theydid the gimp mask.Wild party.And then guys in masksshow up the next morning,and one of them breaks in, butonly steals our car keys. Why?Who cares? We're in thismess because this douchebagdoxed us on an incel forum.Just help me piece togetherwhat happened last night.I arrived at nine.There were a few other peoplefrom college, but also othersI've never seen before.Who were they?Friends of friends?There were like 35, 40 peoplewhen I got here at eleven.How many did you recognize?Some of the guys Iknew from football.Like Tom and Jeff.A few from campus.I don't know. Maybe half.Who were the other guysin the group email invite?I don't know. I wasn't onany group email invite.It was bcc. You couldn'tsee the other names.No, that there waspersonally addressed to me.You also texted me,when I didn't reply.'Patrick, hope you gotmy mail. Sophie and I arethrowing a party on Fridaynight at my dads' place.Hope you and Melaniecan make it. Jo.'I thought it might helpsmooth things over. All right?You said, I should be pissedthat he brought Melanie.Did I?Yeah. Before you saidwe should get revenge bymaking out in front of him.I fucking see this.There's nothing to see.Oh, really? You whisperpoison in her ears,while we're together.And then set this wholething up, so you could justfuck her on the rebound.Sophie, don't listento this asshole.He brought Melanie herejust to make you jealous.I only fucking brought her herebecause you invited her.Is that why half the guyswere from my football team?I mean, why would a wokevegan like you even wantto hang out with frat boys?- Because of the Bro Code,Sophie is off fucking limits,Jo. - The Bro Code is a lie.Did you invite Melanie?Sophie, please don'tstart thinking like this.Look, I know a lot of peopleget scared when they realizetheir true sexuality.But I promise you,there's nothing to be afraid of.Please.I need some space.You know, for a lesbian,you're a real fucking dick.No. I said, I don'twant any more.No, I wanna get off.No, no, no.Hey, you okay?You've been in here for a while.Just needed some time to think.You know, sometimesshit happens when you're drunk.And you do stuff,you're not proud of.Like a few weeks back,Tom and Jeff beat up thisguy outside this bar.I mean...I was there, and I didn'thit him or anything, but...I didn't do anythingto stop them either.All I'm saying is, itdoesn't necessarilydefine you as a person.I know, it must suck to haveJo take advantage of you,but that doesn't mean that...That I'm a lesbian?That's not what I meant, Sophie.Just, you know,we've had plenty of sex, andI like to think you liked it.Otherwise, I guess youwouldn't have had it with me.Unless you were gay.That would explainwhy you broke up with me.I told you.I've been offered a job withDeutsche Bank in New York,and I don't want to be in along distance relationship.I could look for work there.Isn't being a coupleabout making a path together?Our careers don't haveto determine our lives.Men only say that becausethey expect a woman tosacrifice her career.Do you know how many womenhave sidelined themselvesbecause they needed to organizetheir lives around theirhusbands, kids, sick parents,or some other family shit?That's not happening to me.I'm going to besuccessful in my own rightand everyone can organizetheir shit around that.I wasn't asking you tosacrifice anything, Sophie.I don't want to go overthis again, Patrick.That doesn't soundlike Tom and Jeff.The fight at the bar.They've been hangingout with this new guy.He's a real shit-stirrer.Was he at the party?Yeah, but I've neverreally spoken to him.He just sort of blendsinto the background.If they came after youposted the photo, thenhow did Pig get in?And why not do somethingwhile in here?They took my keys.But he couldn'thave taken them this morning.Because you were already missingyour keys when you woke up.And Rabbit already hadthem, while Pig wasstill in the house.Maybe Pig threwthem out the window?I'll bet they also tookJo's car keys,to stop usmaking a run for it.How did Pig find them,if he was also hiding from us?But we do know therewere people at the partysearching through cupboards.Yeah, and they couldmove freely around the house.That means they were herebefore I posted the photo.Exactly. It's a pretext.Maybe that's why I don'tremember writing it.Does anyone know your code?Fuck, I was so wastedlast night, anybody couldhave seen me punch it in.Hold up.Maybe that explainswhy my phone was in here.If someone would havewanted to use it...They would havewanted some privacy.Fuck me.But what's upwith the gimp mask?Guys, what's happening?What's happening, isthat not only do youowe Sophie an apology.You also owe me one.They were here.At the party.But that's crazy.Who would do that?Why?Do you have any enemies?Aside from us, obviously.Any online harassment?Yes, but so does everyother woman who'svocal about gay rights.Check the comments.'Dyke, bitch, whore,feminazi, blah, blah blah.''Dick pic, rape, rape rape.''Kneel before thetowering majestic phallus.'Who sent that one?The Big Gay Bunny.Two weeks ago.They aren't here,because of something I posted.They're here because of you.Fuck this shit.We're going.What do you mean,you're going?We wasted way too much timestaying here and listeningto all your bullshit, Jo.There's no fuckingpoint in waiting forsomeone to come help us,when no one is fucking coming.Let's go.I can't see what's happening.It may be a trap.If the engine's stillon, then the keys muststill be in the car.Yeah.What?They'll be watching the door.Yeah.Looks clear.That's Melanie's car.Where is she?What the fuck is she doing here?Run.Stop, stop.Oh, shit.Go! Get in the car.Go.I can't see the other one?Fuck, get back inside.Get back inside. Go, go!Fuck!Come on.Jo, get in.- Come on, Jo.- Come on, get in.All right. Let's go.Come on, man.Hands off!Jesus, fuck.Jesus Q, motherfuck.What is wrong with you?You should be out of herenow, driving to the police.I'm not leavingyou here with these freaks.What good are you, if you'retrapped in here with me?Hey, stop.Why the fuck wasMelanie's car out there?Fuck.I have to admit,I was getting kind of bored.Mel!Take another step and shedies like a lesbian's dog.I'm calling the cops.Again?I've seen smarter lab mice.Let her go.Melanie here would like to knowwhere her necklace is,and where you were last night.Yet another womanmaking demands of our Patrick.How do you know her name?Driver's license.Mel, I'm coming to getyou, okay? Don't letthat fuck scare you.You hear that, Melanie?They're making ahashtag for you.Bring back our girl.I bet all the Libswill retweet it.I'll have no choicebut to let you go,once Oprah's book clubendorses hashtag BBOG.How about a live videoinstead of a hashtag?Oh, Sophie, how can someoneso smart still not get it?Anything you say will beused as evidence againstyou in a court of law.That's not the threatyou think it is.Because you think the justicesystem has collapsed?No.Because I'm alsolive streaming this.Bullshit.Search for the Big GayBunny on Instagram.Where are youstreaming this, Sophie?Some of my viewers want toopen it in another window.What the fuck is this?That's what everyonewants to know:Am I a psycho threateningthis poor young girl's life?Or am I an actor with some bluntscissors, threatening a girl,who hopes she gets a speakingline in this gonzo movie?Easy question.You're a fucking psycho.Oh, but you would say that.You're inside the movie.I'm more interested inwhat our viewers think.How many peopleare watching?Thousands.Everyone wants to know:How's it going to end?With you in fucking prison.Sadly, that Truman Showreference went rightover her dyke haircut.But you can't expect much fromthe intersectionally inferior.Now for a montage ofaudience reaction shots.Guys, you've gotto do your part.He's making it sono one knows this is real.There's no suchthing as reality.There is only the matrix.And you are Neo.And now you are goingto talk about redpillingand how you spent your teenageyears beating off at theidea of being Keanu Reeves.Correction. I spent thembeating off to Keanu Reeves.I was very confused aboutmy sexuality, which is whyI'm so mean to gay people.Is it?Oh, for fuck's sake, Jo.Try to understand.There is no gay,straight, black, white,because there's no one leftto tell us what reality is.No Walter Cronkite to say,'this is today's news.'What arrogance.But where's Walter, man?Just another guy in a stripedshirt, lost in the crowd.We all live in our ownpersonal discourse now.Maybe you're looking at methrough the window.Or with me andMelanie in close up.But there's no God-like WalterCronkite seat on the action.So you can screamwhatever you want.People are going to hearwhatever they choose to hear.Let's see what the cops think.Bunch of kids playing a prank.The whole Internet?Some unemployed actors whofailed the audition with theRoyal Shakespeare Company.Is this a scissors,I see before me?I have thee not.And yet I see thee still.Don't!Please let me go.Oh, she does geta line after all.No! God.Fuck.Fucking hell.Fuck.Fuck's sake.- Jesus.- No.Fuck's sake.No, he's got a gun.It's too dangerous.But are you surethe gun is real?Fuck this guy.No, fuck Jo.That was the deal.Now, my viewersare getting bored,and I need to get home,so I can put my kids to bed.Your what?It's important to read to yourkids every night before sleep.I don't want them to bethe kind of morons, whowatch shit like this.No offense, guys.You have until nine.Then I want to see Jo's tittiesjiggling in the window,while Patrick takesher virginity.Wow. Lot of love forJo's jiggling titties.Thanks everyone.Keep your suggestions coming.Kiss me.We need to stick together.Come on.What is the point?I'm not dying in here.You okay?They're the ones who did this.Not you.Melanie would still be alive,if she never met me.- Help me unmask them.- What's the point?Once we know who they are, wecan work out how to stop them.And if that don't work?Then we have to go with Plan B.Let's start with what we know.They've been stalking Jo onlinefor at least a couple of weeks.Wolf and Pig never speak,which suggests we wouldrecognize their voices.So I think theywere at the party.What about the blond guy?He arrived alone.He didn't strike meas the incel type.What about the guy in the suit?He was pretty charming.I remember that.If he's guilty of anything,it's most likely the usedcondom Jo found in her bedroom.Gross.Yeah, that was probablyhim and the redheaded girl.What about Tom andJeff's new friend?That sadistic asshole?Yeah, maybe.But what's the connectionwith the gimp mask? Or thecoke in the medicine cupboard?Or the cheese grater?Oh my fucking God, guys.Melanie just died.She was just killedin front of us.Who gives a fucking fuckabout a fucking cheese grater?Do you have anythingpositive to contribute?Anything other thanthis shit is fine by me.Okay. Then I guesswe're discussing plan B.What's plan B?We'll see what happens,if we give them what they want.Excuse me?Rabbit keeps saying, ifwe give them what theywant, they'll leave.Have you forgotten whatit is, that they want?No.Oh my God.You didn't have any problemgetting me drunk last night,setting up the wholething with Patrick andMelanie and my necklace.But it's okay for you to goall Brock Turner, becauseyou don't have a penis?I'm not doing it.And I'm not dying in here.So if you have to do aperfectly natural actto get us out of this...Then we need tostart considering it.Guys, stop. It's not goingto fucking happen, okay?What does Melanie's necklacehave to do with any of this?My necklace.That was my grandmother's.I forgot it at your placeafter we broke up.Is that why you were so upset?You had no right to just pass iton to your new girlfriend.That's what you said to me.Right before we started kissing.Wait, did you make out withJo, because you were pissedoff about the necklace?I know, you think, youwere awakening my dormantlesbian sexuality.But you're not the firstwoman I've been with.She's not?So you're bi?No.Look. Sexuality isa big thing for you.For me, it's justanother bodily function.When I'm hungry, I eat.When I'm tired, I sleep.When I'm horny, I fuck.Male, female, notthat big an issue.Why didn't I know about thiswhen we were together?You had a wholemonogamy obsession.But...You've been trying to get inmy pants since the day we met.Congratulations. You werenearby when I needed someone.That's not helpful, Jo.Jesus Christ, Sophie.Leave her alone.I'm sorry, but we haveto stop giving a shitabout who fucked whoand start thinking ofways to get out of here.Speaking as someone who'sbi, to use your terminology,taking a dick insideyou isn't a big deal.We can see what happens,if we call their bluff.Nice job, Sophie.I know you were with otherpeople when we were together.But what bothered methe most was how easyyou would lie about it.Then why didn't youbreak up with me?Because I loved you.You cold-hearted bitch.You were right.We should havemade a run for it.I'm sorry, Jo.I can't stay here any longer.When Sophie and I weredating, there were times,I thought she was autistic.I mean...She's a good personand all, but...She just has this coldnesssometimes, you know.She's just so fucking pretty.Sometimes it's hard to seeanything else, but thatbeautiful face of hers.Do you know howSophie and I first met?I was the only personat the art house cinema,for a screeningof Jeanne Dielman.It's this Belgian feministclassic from the 1970s.And it is sonotoriously dreary, thatI couldn't even convince otherfeminists to watch it with me.Fucking hell.And then the doors opened.And there's this beautiful girlstanding in the light.I spent half the filmjust watching her.Every time she fixed her hairor crossed her legs.Just the two of usin that big room.And I had to go talk to herafterwards, I mean...She was the smartestperson I've ever met.Mind like a scalpel.Just my luck, she's straight.And, you know, I kind ofreconciled myself with that.But then last night...She just seemedless controlled than usual.There was something wild in her.So for a couple of hours,I thought: 'This is it.It's really happening.'And I knew I was going to payfor being that happy.I just...I just didn't know it was goingto be this bad, you know?Yeah, she has thateffect on people.Yeah.What they did...It's not your fault.Yeah.And maybe this whole thingain't your fault either.Okay, first things first.You've got to apologize to Jo.We don't have time for this.Yes, we do.I'm sorry.All right? Good.Now I just need you to checkyour recent social media posts.Why?Because I'd like to know if acertain Big Gay Bunny Man hasbeen following you as well.Recognize someone?Yeah, your friends Tomand Jeff really like my selfies.They've given mealmost as many likes as Jo.- Check the red dress photo.- Why?Because it wasparticularly slutty.This is pointless.There's no reason...What?'If you'll fuck anything,then why not also thosewho least deserve it.''The BGB.'Let me see.That was over a month ago.What the fuck is going on?I don't know, but...I think Sophie's right.They were at the party.But why the cheese grater?Someone was using itin the laundry room.To grate rat poisontablets into powder.They were goingto poison someone.We're the ones, they'vebeen stalking online.Then something happened.Jo and I started making out.So we were too busy to drink.Did Pig sleep in here? How wouldthat be part of their plan?You're overthinking this.I mean, what is the simplestexplanation for someone crashingon the floor after a party?You're shitfaced.Who were the mostshitfaced guys at the party?Aside from me?Easy. Tom and Jeff.More so Jeff.He was off the rails.Wait, hold up.You two guys are not actuallysuggesting that Jeff is theLittle Horny Pig, right?Let's game this out.You're Jeff.Somehow you end upin an incel group.- Wait, Sophie. That's insane.- No, I want to hear this.Whatever the plan was,it didn't pan out.You get utterly shitfacedand pass out in the office.Then you wake upand have to sneak out.You sneak past us while we'redistracted by Wolf and Rabbit.But then you realizeyou've left a bag of cokein the medicine cupboard.So you hide in hereand wait for a chance to get it.And then I come into Jo's roomfor a change of clothes.And go into the bathroom.And because I'm a big perv,I come to watch.Wolf and Rabbit were tryingto peek in the window when Ifirst pulled the curtain back.Because they werelooking for Pig.So they distracted us,so that he could sneak past.Which is why Pig didn't attack.He didn't break in.He was trying to break out.Then why the gimp mask,and why leave it?Because if you're Tomand Jeff, you wouldn'tfollow instructions.That's why Wolf iswearing a bear mask.And Jeff bought this oneinstead of a pig mask.He would have justthought it was funny.But how did the necklaceend up in the hallway?That was me.What?I asked Melanie to wear it,to piss you off.But when I saw how upsetyou were, I took it back.That's why she left.Then I...left it on the table for you andwent to the bathroomto throw up.Thanks for gettingmy necklace back.I'm sorry, I kept itafter we broke up.If Pig is Jeff,then Wolf has got to be Tom.That is why they never speak.But those guys are harmless.They would never kill someoneor even someone's dog.I mean...Tom loves dogs. It's just...It doesn't add up.But neither of them were there.It was Rabbit both times.So if they are Tom and Jeff...Then they don't know.Because it's a fucking prank.They're just frat boyshaving a laugh.Except for Rabbit.But if they're that dumb,we can't just send them thevideo of Rabbit killing Melanie.He'll talk them outof believing in it.So what do we do?Gentlemen of culture,thank you for joining us.We're about to find out if ourbrother Patrick will proclaimthe mastery of thepenis over our would-belesbian overlords...Or if he's just anotherpussy-whipped pseudo male.There's like no fuckingway, they're gonna do it.I would piss myselfif they did though.Wolf, Pig, not while streaming.The time is 9 p.m.We're going to have to sendthem another reminder.Dude, I already told you.I'm out of here at 10.I can't believe they're stayingin there for this long,but I've got training at six.Yeah, and he's my ride, so...What?Oh, my God. Hey.Oh, my God.Hey, look.No fucking way.This is crazy, man.I didn't believethey were gonna do it.Pig, please get closerand verify that sheis being penetrated.Wolf, please stop Sophiemaking a run out the front door.But I don't wantto miss the show.Just fucking do it.- Hello, Tom.- Shit.There's somethingyou need to see.Titties jigglingenough for you, Jeff?Fuck you, Jeff. We know it'syou under the mask, asshole.That was amazing.Oh my God.That was so good.I cannot believe that happened.Oh, my God.You're an idiot.That was crazy.Oh, my God.That was so.I cannot believe that happened.Oh man, you idiot.Do you know what justfucking happened there?No, that was crazy.Best thing I've ever, like...That was so good, man.You idiot. That was...- Oh, my God.- Jeff?Tom. That was so...That was so crazy,though. Did you just?Did you just?- Jeff, there's somethingyou need to see. -That was so crazy.Jeff!Please, let me go.Fuck.Fucking hell.But it was just a...I think this shitgot out of hand, man.I mean, did Melanie reallyjust take the bus home?That's what you think happened?It was just a...It was just a prank.Once we guessed thesetwo were Tom and Jeff, weknew it was all just you.So now it's fiveagainst one, asshole.Let's grab this fuck.Those two were the kind of guys,that make me understandwhat feminists have against men.Go, go.The police can't ignore this.Probably not.To paraphrase Stalin, '3 milliondeaths would be a statistic,but three is unfortunatelyjust murder.'Then shouldn't you be running?Like a rabbit?Who do you think I am?Were you at the party?Picture any scenefrom last night.See that nondescript whiteguy in the background?You could have saidhi at any time.Maybe then I mighthave let you live.Who are you?I'm the nice guy that allthe girls swipe left on.I'm the better candidatewho didn't get the promotion,because we need to supportwomen and minorities.I'm the straight, white,middle class male,that your culture saysneeds to be punishedfor the crime of being himself.So you're the real victim here?You're not a fucking hero.And that leaves onlyone role. I've read yourcritical race theorists,your queer post-colonials,your anti-phallogocentricfeminists.They are all about exposingguys like me as monsters.You want to knowthe weird thing?I used to be agenuinely nice guy.I recycled.I volunteered for worthy causes.I even had a posterof Barack Obama.But if this culture needs meto be a monster...Then a monster is whatit's going to get.You don't have to do this.I'm as mad as hell, and I'mnot going to take it anymore.You are crazy.I'm quoting PeterFinch in Network, Jo.It's a classic. Try to keep up.At least our viewersgot that reference.Wait, you're stillstreaming this shit?Of course. I'm getting likePewDiePie level numbers.Right now, chat isall about how you guyswill keep me talkinguntil the cops arrive.So what's the plan?Sophie finally goingto get her tits out?Guys, it's the Internet.If people get bored for10 seconds, they're gone.And I haven't killed someonein, like, 3 minutes.So, I promise not to kill youbefore the police arrive, if...Drum roll...Jo sucks Patrick's cockuntil they get here.Fuck you.Let me put that another way:Would you rather die,than suck a man's penis?No.I don't see why you're againstit. You've got the good bit.No to all your bullshit.You're going tobe a hero now, Patrick?No.I'm kind of a shittyperson to be honest.But I don't have tostand by anymore whileyou degrade others.I'm not going toparticipate in this shit.I can still tell you to shut thefuck up, and I'm going to standbetween you and them, so I cantell you where to shove it.Wow, Patrick.I guess this is thepart of the movie whereI congratulate you onfinally learning what itmeans to be a real man...and let you all go.If this movie werePhone Booth...Which it's not.Because this isn'tthe kind of movie...Fuck you.This isn't the kindof movie in which wokeliberal values triumph.You act like this isall part of your script,but that's bullshit.This was never your plan.You fucked up last night.What was the rat poison for?This house was full offemale rodents who thinkthey're too good for men.Jo, who doesn't need themfor sex, you, who don'tneed them for your career,and Melanie, who turneddown the chance to get spitroasted by Tom and Jeff.And if there is one thing welearn from watching porn,it's that women lovetwo dicks at once.But then Jo and Istarted making out.No, we were fine with that.But then Melanie stormed off,and we couldn'tpin the whole thing on Patrick,because the dumbasspassed out in the toilet.But this is even better.A die hard feminazi lesbiandying in the kitchen,the way a woman should.Where were your beliefsin gender fluidity whenPatrick needed them, Jo?I thought everythingwas a social construct,but ask you to suck yourfriend's cock for a coupleof minutes to save his lifeand suddenly it's all'Oh no, it would be abetrayal of my identity.'How could you know?You're not a woman.Thank God.That's a quote froma movie, you moron.Okay, I'll bite.What movie?And here I thought,you knew all the movies.Jeanne Dielman.Never heard of it.It's a feminist classic.Then I'm glad I haven't seen it.Too bad. If you had,you'd understand whatyou've overlooked.Too bad for you, that I havethousands of pop culturenerds following live.Nerd marines, ten hut.Why is this bitchtalking about Jeanne Dielman?And you wonder whyyou're still a virgin?The audience is goingto love this theory.Because you're a cowardwho wilts like a flaccid cock,the moment anyonecan see his face.You?But you're notsome twisted loser.Even now, with allyour intelligence,you comfort yourselfwith the belief that peoplelike me are anomalies,deviants, marginal cases.But do you hear that, Sophie?That is the silence of no onecoming to your rescue.We're your manifesto.I didn't come here to punish youfor something you are or did.I came here todemonstrate a truth,your kind refuses to accept:The liberal order is over.What do you mean, noneof you shitheads hasseen Jeanne Dielman?It's called collectiveintelligence, notcollective ignorance.Patrick?Come on, Patrick. No.Patrick.Jo? Jo?I'm calling an ambulance.You're gonna be okay.It's okay, Jo. It's okay.Jo. Jo, they're coming.You're gonna be okay.I promise.I said, I'd protect you.It's gonna be okay.Okay. It's gonna be okay.Jo, you're gonna be okay.You're gonna be okay.Jo? Jo?Jo? Jo? Jo?Jo?Don't leave me.They're not comingfor you, you moron.Open up.Ma'am, we need youto open this door now.Break it down.
