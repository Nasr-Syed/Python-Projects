Bye!Monarch Insider?And you say she took a pictureof this... staff member?-Yes, she truly believesshe met the Count.The only way toget ahead of thisis to finally release the truth.We can't.We'd go from havingat least some touriststo absolutely none.-We're headed there either way.Not necessarily.If this reporter alreadybelieves this manto be the Count,perhaps a new solutionhas just presented itself.You couldhave been fired!What were you thinking?-Honestly, I was moreimpressed with that journalist.She just barged in therethinking that she couldget a private interviewwith the Count.I'll tell you, the confidencethat that requires...-Sounds like she'soff her rocker.Besides Jensen, is thereany security at that palace?Our securityis the best in Nordin.-Ah, Sir Gustus! Um...can I get you anything?Uh... tea, coffee? Danish?-No, thank you.I just need amoment alone with...with Mr. Pederson.-I'll be in the back.I'm so sorry again aboutwhat happened today.- Mr. Pederson...- Oh, please, call me Adam.-Mr. Pederson, afterconveying our incidentto the Royal Council,much to my dismayI've been sent hereto speak with you.-Hmm?-Thanks to youroutright desire to lie,this reporter believesshe met the Count today.If that photo is released,it will cause a crisisof grand proportionfor the Royal Family.-Just release a photoof the real Count.Discredit hers.What I'm about to tell youdemands the utmost secrecy.Do you understand?-Yes.Sir.-There is...no Count of Sorhagen.-Yes, there is.-Count Lars abdicatedthe title four years agowhen he fell inlove with someoneon Spring Breakat Daytona Beach.-Let me guess...what happened in Daytonadidn't stay in Daytona?-Precisely.He's been with her ever since.He threw that medallionout the window in protest.We've been lookingfor it for some time.-Really?Because it was justright... well, hang on,why are you tellingme all of this?-Because the RoyalCouncil believesthis is an opportunity toavoid a bigger scandal.Since this reporter alreadybelieves you to be the Count,will you step inasthe Count for...a brief interview?She'll have toturn over the photoin order to speak with you.We'll satisfy her curiosity,allow her to publisha puff piece about how politeand cordial the Count is.Oh, you're serious?-Just one very short,very rehearsed 15 minutes.-Are you sure that'ssuch a good idea?-The Royal Council knowsthat businesses heredepend on touristsbelieving there is a Count.They feel a short interviewwill keep that belief alive.It's Kirsten!-Come in!-Lost you on the tour today.I was worriedsomething happened,but then Sir Gustus toldme to give you this.What's going on?What?!I've got the interview!I got the interview!Shouldersback. Chin up.Ugh...You sure this is reallynecessary just for an interview?-Decorum and eleganceis the standardfor the Nordin Royal Family.Ow!You sure you're qualifiedto tailor a suit?-Would you prefer thatI called on Mr. Henrik,Sorhagen's chief suit-maker,and have you explainhow your indiscretionwith that reporter ledus to this charade?Chop chop!-Feet flat on the ground.Your back, straight.Your buttocks should touchthe back of the chair.Your weight evenlydistributed over both hips.Got it?-I've got... ow! Ahundred pins in me.The Count wouldnever wear glasses to the press.-Hey! I need thoseto be able to see.-We got you contacts.Wait... how did youknow my prescription?-We have resources.A reporter fromthe Monarch Insiderwill be able to tell afake from a mile away.Remember, keep it light and fun.She needs to believeshe met the Count.We must do somethingabout your hair...Miss Collins.You clean up nice.A properintroduction this time.Miss Collins, LarsLudwig Von Taylor,the Count of Sorhagen.Before we start, I must askif you've deleted the photothat you took ofCount Lars yesterday.-Yes, you made itvery clear: no photos.-And the agreement?-Signed, sealed, and delivered.-Ah!You may commence.-Your Grace, thank you somuch for allowing this.I'm very sorry forbombarding you yesterday;there's just no other way ofgetting in contact with you.Which brings me tomy first question:why are you so private?-I feel that thebest way to servethe country of Nordin is...out of the limelight.-Right, that's what allyour press releases say,but what does thatactually mean?-It means he doesn'tget bogged downwith the showmanshipof the position.-Yes.However, Sorhagen'seconomy has sufferedsince your father passed,and many people believethat's because you haven'tmade any public appearances.You don't feel anyresponsibility to your country?-Uh... perhaps you'dlike to ask aboutthe Count's Children's Charity?-Sir Gustus, no offence,but maybe the Count wouldfeel more comfortableif it were just us?-No.Copy that. Okay.Well, um, what doyou do for fun?-I, uh, serve on...the Royal Warrant...Appointment... Committeeand The Northern European...Trust of Commerce.Ah.Oh, you're serious?Oh, wow.

Itried to stop him.I don't think hetruly comprehendswhat a full Christmasspread with a publicationlike the MonarchInsider will entail.-What do we do now?-We stick to the plan.Sir Gustus willhave to take charge.-Oh!-Oversee that wegive the journalisttidbits here and there.And keep her and Mr. Pederson'sinteractions minimal, hmm?If all goes well, we walkaway with an uptick in tourismand time to find a morepermanent solution.-With all due respect,keeping Mr. Pedersonin line might be a...a tall order.-Surely not for you, Sir Gustus.The King has theutmost faith in you.So, let meget this straight...there's actually no Count,but now you're the Count?-Yeah, see, I am...I am temporarily...pretending to be the Count.But, you see, becauseshe's doing an exclusiveon Christmas with the Count,that means that I getto stay at the Palace,which apparently meansthat I can order anythingfrom the kitchens.Now, that is a pretty sweet gig.This is madness!-Actually...come to think about it, Iprobably shouldn't be out.Sir Gustus gave me a lectureabout keeping a low profilebecause, well, the journalist...she's staying atTrina's B&B nearby.-Oh, then she'sprobably met Kirsten.Maybe you could, uh, findout if they know each other?-Oh, yeah.No, sure, in addition topretending to be the CountI'm gonna ask a prestigiousjournalist to play matchmakerto the B&B owner's niece.-Wouldn't be the craziestthing happening here.Fair enough.That's her!Oh... okay.Now I get why you'repretending to be a Count.-Well, what do I do?-First off, stop acting weirdand stop looking back at her!What are you, Superman?You look the same!-Oh...let's go out the back door!Ahh!Smooth...-I am so sorry.Uh...- Your Grace?- Uh...- Hi.- You look so different.-I do look different, because...I am undercover.Yes, you see, the Count cannotjust go into a local puband have a drinklike everyone else.No, I have to use a disguise.Uh... this is Jensen.He is my personalsecurity guard.He goes with me everywherewhen I am... undercover.-Right.-Nice to meet you.-Oh, great to meet you.Hey, listen, I wasthinking we could startthe exclusive right now.-No, I don't thinkthat's a good idea.-It's a great idea!There's a Christmasshuffleboard game back there.- Sjoelbak?- Sjoelbak!Right, that.For every point I score, Iget to ask you a question.Let's go!I'll, um, see youback at the palace?-I'll make sure yourbed is turned down...my liege.So that's how you've keptprivate for so long, huh?No one here knowswho you actually are.-Uh, yes, yes.They all think I'm a local.So it's just somethingI do to unwind,I just put on a disguiseand just, you know,go out into town.-I knew there was an explanationfor those cheap clothesand this wrinkled mess...it's a disguise.Woo!-Good to know how muchappearances mean to you.-Well, no, it's just Iwas making an observationon attire I've neverseen a royal wear.Aw... oh!- Okay, again. Oh!- Oh!- Ah! Now...- Okay.- Now, now, now, watch.- Yeah.-Now, don't aimfor the first one,aim for the second one,because once you get a set,you double the score.Yeah, yeah,yeah. Oh!-Or you could do that.- Yeah!- Wow.Uh, are you sure you've neverplayed this game before?-I have beginner's luck.It's really interesting,you know, this morning,you were so stiff.Up until I mentioned Christmas.But here, you justseem more regular.-Oh, is, um... regular agood thing or a bad thing?-Well, it depends.-Depends on what?-On what kind ofCount you want to be.Oh...-I... want to bethe kind of Countthat beats you at Sjoelbak.-Mm-hm?

You're funny.So,what's in the bag?-Right, well, are you readyfor your first official RoyalSorhagen Christmas tradition?-Yes, I'm ready.-Ta-da!-Oh, it's a gnome!-Uh, no, it's a Nisse.Totally different.-Oh.-It's a mythologicalcreature that symbolizesthe Nordic Winter Solstice.And we, um, hide themall over the groundsso that children can find themand win prizes.- Ah.So an Easter EggHunt with gnomes?-Oh.I wasn't aware that humouris what you were gnome for.Good one!-Well, this was my favouriteChristmas tradition as a child.Yeah, my parents used tobring me here every year.-Well, yeah, didn'tyou grow up here?-Oh, yes.No, I meant that I alsogot to participate.-Oh, okay.Are you close with therest of your family?Like Lord Limburg,who's technically bothyour father's first cousin andyour mother's fourth cousintwice removed, but theonly living relativeon your maternal side?-Wait a minute...You know all that, but youdon't know what Nisse are?-Well, my mother wasa history professor.Royal bloodlines fascinated us.-Oh!You must reallylove what you do,working in such a prestigiousand historical publication.-Well, I'm good at it, butbeing good at somethingdoesn't necessarily meanyou're passionate about it.-Huh!Well, at least you'renot still trying tofigure out yourdirection in life.I don't even know whereto focus my endeavours,let alone know what I'm good at.-Well, must be nice being ableto figure out your passionwithout any monetaryconsequences.-You do know that money can'tbuy you happiness, right?-Ha! Says the Count ina million-dollar palace.- Huh.- What?No, it's just...- good to know what yousee when you look at me.Be sure to checkthe Christmas Trees!Slow down!There'll be plenty oftreats to go around!-Nothing like children enjoyingthe true meaning of Christmas.-Uh, is that what you'd call it?-I'm Jensen.-Yeah, I know.

Love to hear it.Now, as you know, visualsare everything, right?Not that I think you would,but you could be makingthe whole thing up, so weneed to release some photos,get some proof going.-Um, you know...Okay, it's all about buildingtrust with him and the firm,and right now that isstill off the table.-We're not in thetrust business,we're in the gossip business!-Yeah.- And as of late, you'vebeen the queen of that,so let's keep that up, yeah?-You know, I don't reallythink of this as gossip.It's more us reportingvery specific news.-Well, you know, my motto is"Like apples and pears, thejuicier the better," yeah?-Great motto.-I need a picture!-Alright, I'm on it.I'm glad to see you'vemade yourself at home.-Mmm!The kitchen staff havebeen very accommodating.You fancy a taste?-No, thank you.We need to talk aboutwhat you tried to doat yesterday's meeting.-Quick question first.If I had been the real Countand suggested usinglocal resources,would you haveturned down my idea?-He would never have triedto impose on royal tradition.-Hmm, didn't the Count chooselove over royal tradition?-Look, I know that allof this is temporary,but Charlotte hasmade me curious.So I requested a list of allthe things being importedfor the ball, and everythingfrom crystal stemware to gloggcan and could come from localbusinesses here in Sorhagen.Why do you care so much?-Being away for solong, I hadn't realizedhow tough things had gottenfor local businesses here.I was just lookingfor ways to help.But you're right, I'mnot the real Count...let alone an economist.I was raised neverto ruffle feathers.My father was the advisorto the Count before Charlesand his father before him.Tradition is all I know.For my entire life, it'sbeen my responsibilityto uphold this legacy.-Sounds suffocating.Whereare you going now?-Well, I promised Charlottethat I would take herto the Wreath Lightingin the town square.-It's not good to gointo town with her.Too much could go wrong.-Don't worry, Gus.I have a foolproof plan.She thinks that thisis the disguise...not this.It's okay to ruffle a fewfeathers once in a while.Actually, it's quite fun.-You're slouching!It's so beautiful.When I was little, my momand I used to make dioramasof medieval towns out of clay.This place reminds me of them.-So you're saying that Sorhagenis stuck in medieval times?-Yeah, but in a good way,with the bonus of electricityand indoor plumbing.-I have missed this place.The town square, I mean.I don't get to comehere that often.-Oh.I have missed goingall out for Christmas.For so long, it was just a daythat reminded me of my mom,which always made me so sad.-And now?-And now, I can seeher loving all this,whispering to me about the greatdebate on the origin of wreaths,and whether they're basedon Greco-Roman coronasor whether their existencedidn't come into fruitionuntil after Christianity as asymbol of never-ending life.-Well, you're welcome towhisper all of that to me.-Mm?-Well, I mean, your eyes getthis special sparkle in themwhen you go all historical.It's really rather lovely.Hmm!Historical Society.Uh, give me one second.I'll be right back.-Mm-hm.What's that?-Oh, it's a brochure fromthe Historical Society.I actually didn't realizethat Nordin Universityhad a history doctorate program.-Huh!Is that something thatyou'd be interested in?-Yeah.You know, being here hasmade me realize, like,I don't know if I reallywant to report on royalsfor my livelihood.-Mm-hm, has spending timewith me really been that badthat you want togive up your career?-No, no, it's just beinghere has ignited passionsI had forgotten about.I don't know. What about you?You know, all thosepeople tonight,I bet they would haveloved to have knowntheir Count was amongst them.- Ah...- Maybe it's time to go public?-But no, I just...well, I don't thinkthat it's really the right time.-Well, when is the right time?What are you afraid of?-Letting people down.-Not possible.- I... we should...- Yeah.- Yeah, probably go.- Okay.-I don't want toupset Sir Gustus.- Yeah.- He might blow a gasket.-Okay. Well, thankyou for tonight.Goodnight, Your Grace.-Goodnight.I don't knowhow this happened.-I'll tell you how it happened.Miss Collins isn't astrustworthy as we thought.Legal action willhave to be taken!-No, no, no, but see,she couldn't have takenthat picture.She had just goneinside that door.-Perhaps she isn'tworking alone?Either way, theruse is surely over.The Royal Family willhave to come clean.-But this was supposedto be a temporary fix,anyway, right?Maybe the truthcan come out now.I mean, perhaps thisis a good thing.-Don't do anything untilI speak to the council.Why didn't you tell methe guy I've been seeing youaround with is the Count?!-Uh...Good morning!Trina here makes the absolutebest eyeball-skeevers.You simply have to try one.- Oh!- This is Tony.He's also a journalist.He's from RoyalGossip Entertainment.-Yes, and I just foundout that you workfor the Monarch Insider?-Well...Prestigious. I'mjealous!-Can I speak to youprivately for a second?-Uh, sure!-What are you doing here?What's with the picture?-I just came to help.I figured you coulduse the big guns.-Help? Help? No, Idon't need your help.This violates theagreement I signed!-No, no, no, no.There's nothing in yourcontract that says your editorcan't fly in and snapone little photo.Now, I do hope thatyou're just pretendingto work for the Monarch Insiderand not actuallythinking of jumping ship.-I said thatbecause I wanted the Countto think I was legitimate.Ouch! But clever.-Oh, what if he thinksI've led you to him?Which, let's behonest, I kinda did.-Come on, you didn'ttake the photo!And perhaps now withhis anonymity gone,he'll be more inclinedto give you more intel.-Oh!-Now, I really dohave to get backand get more of thoseeyeball-skizfers.They really are to die for.-It's pronounced aeble-skiva!I think... Ugh!I needyou both to knowthat I had nothing to dowith that photo being leaked.-How can we be sure?Well, the articlewas leaked by one of those,uh, tabloid sites.I mean, Charlotte doeswork for Monarch Insider.-Yeah.Someone from RGE, they foundout about the exclusiveand followed me here.I'm so sorry. I just...I know you weren't ready tobe a public Count yet, and...-Oh, it's okay, um...Don't think I was ever readyto be any type of Count.-Can I still finish the article?Your Grace.Your uncle, the King,is on the phone demandingto speak to you at once.Address him properly,let him guide the topicof conversation...-And make sure to enunciate!I'm sure he'll callthe whole thing off;it's the sensible thing to do.And stand up straight,for God's sake!-It's a phone call!He can't see me.-Ah-ah!-Your Uncle... Highness?-Mr. Pederson, this hasgotten out of control.-Oh, I agree.I never meant for thisto go so far and...-My royal advisors,the Queen, we'reall very concerned.Mr. Pederson, thisis disastrous.-Why don't we telleveryone the truth?-Absolutely not!That would ruin Sorhagen,our entire country!-Fine, then...I'll make a publicstatement as the Count.-A formal introductionwould be best.We will invite the royalpress to a Julebordhosted by you tomorrownight at the palace.-I'll agree to that...if my mother cancater the desserts.She does makes anaward-winning krumkake.-Do as you please.The Queen and I willsee you tomorrow night.-So... how bad is it?-Well, I am now hosting aJulebord tomorrow night,for the King, Queen,and the royal press.-You are?-Yes.I would love it ifyou could attend.For support.And while there willbe other press there,you will still be the onlyone doing an exclusive onChristmas with the Count.-Ah, thank you! Thank you!It's such an honour.-Look, I do know thatit wasn't your faultthat my photo got out.-Mm-hm.-I know that Ireally can trust you.-Yeah.-Um...What are you doingtomorrow morning?-Why?I doubt she'd recognizeyou in any of those photos.-Can't take any chances.-Darling, I'm worried about you.This is all getting...- Out of hand?Oh, I'm well aware.All because of alittle white lie,I could bring ruin to thistown, the Royal Family,and everything that youhave worked so hard for.-Well, that's a lot ofpressure to put on yourself,especially for someone who'sbeen running from this placefor so long.-Mum, I haven't beenrunning from here.-Really?So, what would you callconstantly travellingfor ten years,avoiding all responsibility?-Looking for my passion.Trying to find ajob that I'm good atand that I can makea difference with.Oh, let's just hope that I canstill make a positive impactbefore I leave again.Oh, here we go!-Ah! Come in! Youmust be Charlotte.-Good morning.Are you two ready to prepfor a Scandinavian feastduring the Christmas seasonwith lots of traditionalfood and drinks?-You had to Google"Julebord," didn't you?-I had to lightlyrefresh my knowledge.-The Count tells mehe wants you to coverthe making of the krumkake.And since being royal doesn'tget you out of helping,both of you can grab an apron.I have to admit I'm reallynot the baking type.You know, my mom and I usedto make Christmas cookies,but they were always from a box.-Krumkake is a classic.Crispy wafers rolled intocones with cream and chocolate.The key is to beat thebutter and sugar first,then gradually add the eggs.-Okay.Oh, uh...-Ooh, you are reallynot good at this.-Oh, and pointing it outreally helps my confidence...What... hmm! Why areyou so good at this?-Well, you know,grew up practicing.-Oh, they have bakingclasses at boarding school?-Yeah, something like that.-Oh.Wow, look at you.The Count of many talents.Oh,you have no idea.Always referto them as "Your Majesty."Do not commence eatinguntil he commences eating.Do not finish untilthe King finishes.-What if he eatsfaster than I do?-You will finishwhen he finishes.How in the worlddid we get here?You ready?-Ready as I'll ever be.Your Majesties.-Good to see you, Nephew.Good to see you, indeed.-Although we respectedand understoodour nephew's desireto remain anonymousas a way to excel in hischaritable endeavours,we must admit we are relievedand overjoyed that he hasnow become a public figure.Since your photographwas released,we've had more noblesand dignitariespurchasing ticketsthe last 48 hoursthan in the lastfour Yuletide balls.-Wonderful for the nobles.Well, if it's ticket sales thatyou're really concerned about,what don't we open theYuletide Ball up to the public?-I beg your pardon?-I learned from an historianthat the originalYuletide was a celebrationto raise the spiritsof the communityduring the long, dark winter.It was something for everyoneto rally around andlook forward to.Think how tourism wouldsoar if we invited everyoneto the Yuletide Ball.-That is a... unique idea.-Perhaps we can discussthis after the Julebord.In private.I apologize if Ioverstepped tonight.-When my brother fell ill,I had a meeting withLars, my real nephew,about what it would mean tohim to become the next Count.Before I could get a word out,he told me he wasn't interestedin being Count.He was in love, and wantedto have a nice, quiet lifewith a random American woman.-Not random to him, dear.-Nevertheless, I was appalled.I pleaded with him.But alas, for some, love,more powerful than country.- So I've heard.- Hmm!Since I only have a daughter,who of course one daywill become Queen, there are noother current heirs or relativesto bestow theimperative title upon.There has been a Counthere for centuries.That is why, Mr. Pederson,we need you tocontinue to be Count,until a better solutionpresents itself.After all, now thatyou're in the public,our hands our tied.-Uh...I want to help all I can, but,well, I've already done...exactly what we agreedupon for the interview.-But you must continue.-But I'm leaving thefirst of the year.I have a new job.-Will you at leasthost the Yuletide Ball?Be front and centre, so wecan stretch the publicityas long as possible?-I will.Yes.I will be the hostextraordinaire.-If you open up theball to everyone.And there are a few localvendors that I suggest we hire.-Very well.So, tell me everything!What was the food like?What were the Kingand Queen like?-Okay, so the King andQueen were very proper.The food was delicious.I ate so much.But the best partwas the Count opened up theYuletide Ball to the public!- He what?- Yes!-That Count of yoursis pretty great.-Oh, he's not...he's not mine.-Not yet.-I can't believe how busy it is!-I know!Ever since thatpicture came out,reservations have been up.I am so glad that theCount decided to go public!Oh, I don't think I dressedwarmly enough for this.- Wear my scarf.- Oh!- That'll keep you warm.- Thank you.- It suits you.- Mm...It's breathtaking.-Yes.-Did you know the firstreference of the northern lightswere from cave paintings30,000 years ago?-I did not.-Hmm. Well, now you do.-Do you know that youcan't always see them?But I had a feelingthey'd be out tonight.My father used tobring me here every winter.To me, this is Christmas.You know, it's funny, I...thought I was coming out hereto get an interviewwith the Count,and instead I got the bestChristmas I've ever had.Me, too.There you are!- Oh, I was just, um...- Yeah.- Showing Charlotte the view.- Mm-hm.-Ah, yeah. Well,Sir Gustus sent me.I've been givendirect instructionsto see Charlotteback to the B&B.You know how Gustus getswhen that vein in his necksort of... pops?-Oh, yes. Yes, wewouldn't want that.Oh, no. Yeah...I should get going.Yeah, the last thingI'd want is for himto ban me from doing theexclusive, so... yeah.Goodnight, Charlotte.-Goodnight, Count Lars.Thank you for tonight.Miss Charlotte...Do you think Kirsten has adate to the ball this year?It'sAdam... actually.- Hi!- Charlotte!What can I get for you?-Well, the Count invited me toLittle ChristmasEve Dinner tonight.-Ooh!-Which Kirsten thankfullyinformed me meansthe night before Christmas Eveand not something to do withlittle, small foods.He's luckyto have your company.- Aww!- Enjoy.-So, I was, um... I washoping to bring a dessert.I just don't knowwhat it should be.-Oh!I have just the thing.Risgrynsgröt...with raspberries anda touch of cinnamon.-Hmm!-It's one of his favourites.-How would you know that?-I meant more it'severyone's favourite.-Well, if you thinkhe'll like it, I'm in.-You care for him, don't you?-Is it that obvious?-And what is it abouthim you admire most?-That's sort of astrange question.-I'm just curious.-Well, um...he's just not really what Ithought a Count would be like.You know, it's funny,there's actually notmuch regality to him.He's, uh...he's kind, and he'sadventurous, and...And he'skind of a dork.-I'll go grab you those bowls.-Thank you!-OMG!Do you have a thingfor the Count?-Tony, do you just lurkaround every corner?- It's part of the job.- Okay, it's kinda not.-He's kinda cute, hmm?I could see how one would fall.But this isn't gonna interferewith your write-up, right?I mean, we're looking for juice,not lovestruck admiration.-Tony, I've really beenthinking about this,and these articles wewrite, we treat these peoplelike they only existfor our amusement.- Mm-hm.- And their mistakesand misfortunatesare a good thing.But these are people, okay?And they're doing their best.-Yes, but they are royals, andwe're not and never will be.And people like us, we justlike to peek behind the curtain.-Okay.-So worry a littlebit less about them,and get me what you have so far.-Fine, I'll email you a copy.But I'm just warning you,it's taken on more ofa wholehearted tone.-Oh, darling.
