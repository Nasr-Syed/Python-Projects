# Python Web Scraper Project
### By: Nasr Syed

### In this project, I will browse through a movie website that holds transcripts for thousands of movies. The code has 2 versions. The first one parses through a single page on the website. The site wide version of the code parses through each link, and page, thus successfully scraping an entire site containing thousands of movie links. The files are then written to a .txt file for data storage.
